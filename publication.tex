\subsection{Formatting of Mathematical Components}

This is the example 1 of equation:
\begin{linenomath}
\begin{equation}
a = 1,
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath}
the text following an equation need not be a new paragraph. Please punctuate equations as regular text.
%% If the documentclass option "submit" is chosen, please insert a blank line before and after any math environment (equation and eqnarray environments). This ensures correct linenumbering. The blank line should be removed when the documentclass option is changed to "accept" because the text following an equation should not be a new paragraph.

This is the example 2 of equation:
%\isPreprints{}{% This command is only used for ``preprints''.
\begin{adjustwidth}{-\extralength}{0cm}
%} % If the paper is ``preprints'', please uncomment this parenthesis.
\begin{equation}
a = b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i + j + k + l + m + n + o + p + q + r + s + t + u + v + w + x + y + z
\end{equation}
%\isPreprints{}{% This command is only used for ``preprints''.
\end{adjustwidth}
%} % If the paper is ``preprints'', please uncomment this parenthesis.

%% Example of a page in landscape format (with table and table footnote).

Please punctuate equations as regular text. Theorem-type environments (including propositions, lemmas, corollaries etc.) can be formatted as follows:
%% Example of a theorem:
\begin{Theorem}
Example text of a theorem.
\end{Theorem}

The text continues here. Proofs must be formatted as follows:

%% Example of a proof:
\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem 1]
Text of the proof. Note that the phrase ``of Theorem 1'' is optional if it is clear which theorem is being referred to.
\end{proof}
