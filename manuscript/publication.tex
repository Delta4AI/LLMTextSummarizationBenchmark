% Abstract (Do not insert blank lines, i.e. \\) 
\abstract{The rapid expansion of biomedical literature demands automated summarization tools that can reliably condense research articles into concise, accurate overviews. We benchmarked 62 text summarization methods – ranging from frequency-based and TextRank extractors to modern \acp{EDM} and \acp{LLM} – on a set of 1,000 biomedical abstracts for which author-generated highlights sections were available as reference summaries. Models were evaluated using a composite suite of metrics covering lexical overlap (ROUGE-1/2/L, BLEU, METEOR), embedding-based semantic similarity (RoBERTa, DeBERTa, all-mpnet-base-v2), and factual consistency (AlignScore). Our results indicate that general-purpose \acp{LM} achieve the highest overall scores across both lexical and semantic metrics, outperforming both reasoning-oriented and domain-specific models. Within the general-purpose group, medium-sized models, typically runnable on a single node, often outperform frontier-scale counterparts, suggesting an optimal balance between model capacity and computational efficiency. Statistical extractive methods lag behind all neural approaches. These findings provide a systematic reference for selecting summarization tools in biomedical research and highlight that broad pretraining remains more effective than narrow domain adaptation for generating high-quality scientific summaries.}
