    "title": "Big Data-Enabled Repurposing of Clopidogrel for Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis Using Network Biology",
    "abstract": "Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a rare kidney disease characterized by glomerular lesions and damage to podocytes, terminally differentiated renal cells, that are part of the filtration apparatus in glomeruli. FSGS is often associated with nephrotic syndrome and may lead to end-stage renal failure. FSGS pathophysiology is complex with a number of molecular mechanisms being involved in its development and progression. We used a network-based drug repositioning approach to computationally screen for novel treatment options for FSGS in a systematic way. In brief, we first generated a network-based molecular pathobiology model for FSGS following previously established workflows. FSGS-associated molecular features (i.e., genes and proteins) were mapped onto a human protein–protein dependency network, and network clustering algorithms were used to identify dysregulated FSGS molecular mechanisms and biological processes. Key affected enriched mechanisms included glomerular filtration, cell adhesion and extracellular matrix derangements, inflammation, apoptosis, calcineurin signaling, renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, and platelet activation as well as dysregulation of fibrinolysis. The network-based FSGS pathobiology model was subsequently used to computationally screen against a library of drug mechanism of action molecular models. The platelet inhibitor clopidogrel was identified as one of the top compounds significantly interfering with FSGS pathophysiology based on in silico graph alignment analysis. Due to its potential to beneficially interfere with key dysregulated molecular FSGS processes, its positive in vivo data in ameliorating renal sclerosis, and its favorable safety profile, clopidogrel appears as an attractive candidate for subsequent evaluation in clinical trials.",

    "title": "Glucagon-like peptide 1(GLP-1) in biology and pathology",
    "abstract": "Post-translational proteolytic processing of the preproglucagon gene in the gut results in the formation of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). Owing to its glucose-dependent insulinotropic effect, this hormone was postulated to primarily act as an incretin, i.e. to augment insulin secretion after oral glucose or meal ingestion. In addition, GLP-1 decelerates gastric emptying and suppresses glucagon secretion. Under physiological conditions, GLP-1 acts as a part of the ‘ileal brake’, meaning that is slows the transition of nutrients into the distal gut. Animal studies suggest a role for GLP-1 in the development and growth of the endocrine pancreas. In light of its multiple actions throughout the body, different therapeutic applications of GLP-1 are possible. Promising results have been obtained with GLP-1 in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but its potential to reduce appetite and food intake may also allow its use for the treatment of obesity. While rapid in vivo degradation of GLP-1 has yet prevented its broad clinical use, different pharmacological approaches aiming to extend the in vivo half-life of GLP-1 or to inhibit its inactivation are currently being evaluated. Therefore, antidiabetic treatment based on GLP-1 may become available within the next years. This review will summarize the biological effects of GLP-1, characterize its role in human biology and pathology, and discuss potential clinical applications as well as current clinical studies.",

    "title": "Repurposed Drugs, Molecular Vaccines, Immune‐Modulators, and Nanotherapeutics to Treat and Prevent COVID‐19 Associated with SARS‐CoV‐2, a Deadly Nanovector",
    "abstract": "The deadly pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), caused due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), has paralyzed the world. Although significant methodological advances have been made in the field of viral detection/diagnosis with 251 in vitro diagnostic tests receiving emergency use approval by the US‐FDA, little progress has been made in identifying curative or preventive therapies. This review discusses the current trends and potential future approaches for developing COVID‐19 therapeutics, including repurposed drugs, vaccine candidates, immune‐modulators, convalescent plasma therapy, and antiviral nanoparticles/nanovaccines/combinatorial nanotherapeutics to surmount the pandemic viral strain. Many potent therapeutic candidates emerging via drug‐repurposing could significantly reduce the cost and duration of anti‐COVID‐19 drug development. Gene/protein‐based vaccine candidates that could elicit both humoral and cell‐based immunity would be on the frontlines to prevent the disease. Many emerging nanotechnology‐based interventions will be critical in the fight against the deadly virus by facilitating early detection and enabling target oriented multidrug therapeutics. The therapeutic candidates discussed in this article include remdesivir, dexamethasone, hydroxychloroquine, favilavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, antibody therapeutics like gimsilumab and TJM2, anti‐viral nanoparticles, and nanoparticle‐based DNA and mRNA vaccines.",
