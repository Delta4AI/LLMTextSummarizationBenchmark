    "abstract": "Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) is an increasingly used intervention, but its suitability to restore regional gut microbiota, particularly in the small bowel (SB), must be questioned because of its predominant anaerobic composition. In human subjects receiving FMT by upper endoscopy, duodenal engraftment of anaerobes was observed after 4 weeks. We hypothesized that peroral FMTs create host-microbe mismatches that impact SB homeostasis. To test this, antibiotic-treated specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mice were given jejunal, cecal, or fecal microbiota transplants (JMTs, CMTs, or FMTs, respectively) and studied 1 or 3 months later. JMT and FMT altered regional microbiota membership and function, energy balance, and intestinal and hepatic transcriptomes; JMT favored host metabolic pathways and FMT favored immune pathways. MTs drove regional intestinal identity (Gata4, Gata6, and Satb2) and downstream differentiation markers. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of metabolite-exposed human enteroids and duodenal biopsies post-FMT confirmed transcriptional changes in mice. Thus, regional microbial mismatches after FMTs can lead to unintended consequences and require rethinking of microbiome-based interventions.",

The asymmetric spatiotemporal distribution of auxin generates local gradient patterns, which are regulated by both cellular auxin influx and efflux. The AUXIN1/LIKE-AUX1 (AUX1/LAX) family transporters have been identified as major auxin influx carriers. Here, we characterize the auxin uptake mediated by AUX1 from Arabidopsis thaliana. Using cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), we determine its structure in three states: the auxin-unbound, the auxin-bound, and the competitive inhibitor, 3-chloro-4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (CHPAA)-bound state. All structures adopt an inward-facing conformation. In the auxin-bound structure, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is coordinated to AUX1 primarily through hydrogen bonds with its carboxyl group. The functional roles of key residues in IAA binding are validated by in vitro and in planta analyses. CHPAA binds to the same site as IAA.

    "abstract": "Therapeutically targeting pathogenic T cells in autoimmune diseases has been challenging. Although LAG-3, an inhibitory checkpoint receptor specifically expressed on activated T cells, is known to bind to major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC class II), we demonstrate that MHC class II interaction alone is insufficient for optimal LAG-3 function. Instead, LAG-3’s spatial proximity to T cell receptor (TCR) but not CD4 co-receptor, facilitated by cognate peptide-MHC class II, is crucial in mediating CD4+ T cell suppression. Mechanistically, LAG-3 forms condensate with TCR signaling component CD3ε through its intracellular FSAL motif, disrupting CD3ε/lymphocyte-specific protein kinase (Lck) association. To exploit LAG-3’s proximity to TCR and maximize LAG-3-dependent T cell suppression, we develop an Fc-attenuated LAG-3/TCR inhibitory bispecific antibody to bypass the requirement of cognate peptide-MHC class II. This approach allows for potent suppression of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and effectively alleviates autoimmune symptoms in mouse models. Our findings reveal an intricate and conditional checkpoint modulatory mechanism and highlight targeting of LAG-3/TCR cis-proximity for T cell-driven autoimmune diseases lacking effective and well-tolerated immunotherapies.",

While cytosolic cGAS detects viral DNA, most DNA viruses shield their genome and invade the nucleus, where chromatin restricts cGAS activation. How viruses may activate nuclear cGAS is not well understood. Here, we show that several herpesvirus proteins trigger nuclear cGAS activation by perturbing centromeres, where cGAS is enriched. The herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) ubiquitin ligase infected cell protein 0 (ICP0), which degrades centromeric proteins, promotes centromeric DNA amplification through the translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) pathway in quiescent monocyte-derived cells, thereby activating nuclear cGAS. During infection, HSV-1 evades this detection by also expressing UL36USP, a suppressor of TLS. Similarly to ICP0, the cytomegalovirus IE1 protein causes centromeric DNA amplification and cGAS activation.

We found many time-compressed replay sequences during sleep and during awake pauses between flights, similar to rodents exploring small environments. Individual neurons fired multiple times per replay, according to their multiple place fields. Surprisingly, replays were highly fragmented, depicting short trajectory pieces covering only ∼6% of the environment size—unlike replays in small setups, which cover most of the environment. This fragmented replay may reflect biophysical or network constraints on replay distance and may facilitate memory chunking for hippocampal-neocortical communication.

Here, we demonstrate that TDP-43 aggregation requires a double event. One is up-concentration in stress granules beyond a threshold, and the other is oxidative stress. These two events collectively induce intra-condensate demixing, giving rise to a dynamic TDP-43-enriched phase within stress granules, which subsequently transition into pathological aggregates. Intra-condensate demixing of TDP-43 is observed in iPS-motor neurons, a disease mouse model, and patient samples. Mechanistically, intra-condensate demixing is triggered by local unfolding of the RRM1 domain for intermolecular disulfide bond formation and by increased hydrophobic patch interactions in the C-terminal domain. By engineering TDP-43 variants resistant to intra-condensate demixing, we successfully eliminate pathological TDP-43 aggregates in cells.

Human sweet TRCs express on their cell surface a sweet receptor that initiates the cascade of signaling events responsible for our strong attraction to sweet stimuli. Here, we describe the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the human sweet receptor bound to two of the most widely used artificial sweeteners—sucralose and aspartame. Our results reveal the structural basis for sweet detection, provide insights into how a single receptor mediates all our responses to such a wide range of sweet-tasting compounds, and open up unique possibilities for designing a generation of taste modulators informed by the structure of the human receptor.",

Here, we identified a rice major locus, QT12, which negatively controls grain-quality field thermotolerance by disrupting endosperm storage substance homeostasis through over-activating unfolded protein response (UPR). Natural variations in QT12 and an NF-Y complex form a natural gene on-off system to modulate QT12 expression and thermotolerance. High temperatures weaken NF-YB9/NF-YC10 interactions with NF-YA8, releasing QT12 suppression and triggering quality deterioration. Low QT12 expression confers superior quality and increases elite rice yield up to 1.31–1.93 times under large-scale high-temperature trials. Two trait regulatory haplotypes (TRHs) from co-selected variations of the four genetically unlinked genes in NF-Ys-QT12 were identified for subspecies thermotolerance differentiation.

We provide a detailed perspective of the evolutionary history of the deletion through time and space. We discovered that the CCR5delta32 allele arose on a pre-existing haplotype consisting of 84 variants. Using this information, we developed a haplotype-aware probabilistic model to screen 934 low-coverage ancient genomes and traced the origin of the CCR5delta32 deletion to at least 6,700 years before the present (BP) in the Western Eurasian Steppe region. Furthermore, we present strong evidence for positive selection acting upon the CCR5delta32 haplotype between 8,000 and 2,000 years BP in Western Eurasia and show that the presence of the haplotype in Latin America can be explained by post-Columbian genetic exchanges.

Through machine-learning-assisted evolution of desired aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), we successfully incorporated chemically caged amino acids into rationally designed “decaging sites” to transiently block target proteins’ function, which can be restored in situ via a small-molecule-triggered bioorthogonal cleavage reaction. This method demonstrates broad applicability ranging from activating proteins of interest to cell-type-specific modulation of distinct phenotypes in living systems. Beyond the active-pocket decaging, CAGE-Proxvivo also enables precise control of protein-protein interactions, as exemplified by a “gated” anti-CD3 antibody that permits chemically regulated T cell recruitment and activation at tumor sites.

Codons that are modified with m6A are decoded inefficiently by the ribosome, rendering them “non-optimal” and inducing ribosome collisions on cellular transcripts. This couples mRNA translation to decay. 5-Methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine (mcm5s2U) in the tRNA anticodon loop counteracts this effect. This unanticipated link between the mRNA and tRNA epitranscriptomes enables the coordinated decay of mRNA regulons, including those encoding oncogenic signaling pathways. In cancer, dysregulation of the m6A and mcm5s2U biogenesis pathways—marked by a shift toward more mcm5s2U—is associated with more aggressive tumors and poor prognosis.

We find that m6A is a potent inducer of ribosome stalling, and these stalls lead to ribosome collisions that form a unique conformation unlike those seen in other contexts. We find that the degree of ribosome stalling correlates with m6A-mediated mRNA degradation, and increasing the persistence of collided ribosomes correlates with enhanced m6A-mediated mRNA degradation. Ribosome stalling and collision at m6A is followed by recruitment of YTHDF m6A reader proteins to promote mRNA degradation. We show that mechanisms that reduce ribosome stalling and collisions, such as translation suppression during stress, stabilize m6A-mRNAs and increase their abundance, enabling stress responses.

Impaired bursting was associated with altered hippocampal network activities that are coupled to burst firing patterns (i.e., theta rhythms and high-frequency ripples) and was concurrent with reduced neuronal expression of CaV2.3 calcium channels, which are essential for burst firing in vivo.

Inhibition of SERT using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the most widely prescribed antidepressants, significantly suppressed tumor growth and enhanced T cell antitumor immunity in various mouse syngeneic and human xenograft tumor models.

    "abstract": "Claustrum orchestrates brain functions via its connections with numerous brain regions, but its molecular and cellular organization remains unresolved. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing of 227,750 macaque claustral cells identified 48 transcriptome-defined cell types, with most glutamatergic neurons similar to deep-layer insular neurons. Comparison of macaque, marmoset, and mouse transcriptomes revealed macaque-specific cell types. Retrograde tracer injections at 67 cortical and 7 subcortical regions defined four distinct distribution zones of retrogradely labeled claustral neurons. Joint analysis of whole-brain connectivity and single-cell spatial transcriptome showed that these four zones containing distinct compositions of glutamatergic (but not GABAergic) cell types preferentially connected to specific brain regions with a strong ipsilateral bias. Several macaque-specific glutamatergic cell types in ventral vs. dorsal claustral zones selectively co-projected to two functionally related areas—entorhinal cortex and hippocampus vs. motor cortex and putamen, respectively. These data provide the basis for elucidating the neuronal organization underlying diverse claustral functions.",

The extensive homozygosity and identity-by-descent sharing among individuals reflects strong founder events due to a recent shift toward endogamy. We uncover that most of the genetic variation in Indians stems from a single major migration out of Africa that occurred around 50,000 years ago, followed by 1%–2% gene flow from Neanderthals and Denisovans.

A candidate screen on an orphan lysosome membrane protein (OLMP) library enabled us to discover that SLC7A11, the protein target of the ferroptosis-inducing compound erastin, mediates a slow lysosomal H+ leak through downward flux of cystine and glutamate, two H+ equivalents with uniquely large but opposite concentration gradients across lysosomal membranes. SLC7A11 deficiency or inhibition caused lysosomal over-acidification, reduced degradation, accumulation of storage materials, and ferroptosis, as well as facilitated α-synuclein aggregation in neurons. Correction of abnormal lysosomal acidity restored lysosome homeostasis and prevented ferroptosis.

Pharmacological inhibition of UGCG disrupted cytotoxic granules and cytotoxicity, reduced expansion after viral infection, and promoted apoptosis. B4galt5 transcribes an enzyme downstream of UGCG and possesses SE structure. Addition of its product, lactosylceramide (LacCer), reversed apoptosis due to UGCG inhibition.

Although transcriptional dysregulation has not traditionally been a hallmark of AD, recent studies reveal significant epigenomic changes in late-onset AD (LOAD) patients. We show that altered expression of the LOAD biomarker phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) modulates AD pathology in mice and human brain organoids independent of its enzymatic activity. PHGDH has an uncharacterized role in transcriptional regulation, promoting the transcription of inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit alpha (IKKa) and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) in astrocytes, which suppress autophagy and accelerate amyloid pathology.

We constructed a reference genome and resequenced 26 saola individuals, confirming the saola as a basal member of the Bovini. Despite its small geographic range, we found that the saola is partitioned into two populations with high genetic differentiation (FST = 0.49). We estimate that these populations diverged and started declining 5,000–20,000 years ago, possibly due to climate changes and exacerbated by increasing human activities. The saola has long tracts without genomic diversity; however, most of these tracts are not shared by the two populations. Saolas carry a high genetic load, yet their gradual decline resulted in the purging of the most deleterious genetic variation. Finally, we find that combining the two populations, e.g., in an eventual captive breeding program, would mitigate the genetic load and increase the odds of species survival.",

Broadly neutralizing antibodies and broad chemical inhibitors have been proposed as solutions, but how to develop a therapeutically effective cocktail and the number of required components have been unclear. To address this gap, we iteratively recovered two broadly neutralizing antivenom antibodies from the memory B cells of a hyperimmune human donor with extensive snake venom exposure. The antibodies recognized conserved neutralizing epitopes on prevalent long and short snake neurotoxins, with crystal structures revealing antibody mimicry of the interfaces between these neurotoxins and their host target, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. We combined and tested these antibodies and the phospholipase inhibitor varespladib.

IFNγ production is initiated by antigen-independent activation of lamina propria CD8+ T cells following MyD88-dependent recognition of the microbiota during helminth-induced barrier invasion. IFNγ acted directly on intestinal stromal cells to recruit neutrophils that limited parasite-induced tissue injury. IFNγ sensing also limited the expansion of smooth muscle actin-expressing cells to prevent pathological gut dysmotility.

Phylogeographic analyses show bat sarbecoviruses traveled at rates approximating their horseshoe bat hosts and circulated in Asia for millennia. We find that the direct ancestors of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are unlikely to have reached their respective sites of emergence via dispersal in the bat reservoir alone, supporting interactions with intermediate hosts through wildlife trade playing a role in zoonotic spillover.

Mutations in INT subunits are associated with many human diseases, including cancer, ciliopathies, and neurodevelopmental disorders, but how reduced INT activity contributes to disease is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the loss of INT-mediated termination in human cells triggers the integrated stress response (ISR). INT depletion causes upregulation of short genes such as the ISR transcription factor activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3). Further, immature RNAPII that escapes into genes upon INT depletion is prone to premature termination, generating incomplete pre-mRNAs with retained introns. Retroelements within retained introns form double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that is recognized by protein kinase R (PKR), which drives ATF4 activation and prolonged ISR.

Focusing on binding sites for 38 TFs and their pairwise interactions, we found that identical sites displayed both repressive and activating function as a consequence of cell state, site combinatorics, or simply predicted occupancy of a TF on an enhancer. Surprisingly, combinations of activating sites frequently neutralized one another or gained repressive function.

Notably, chemical disruption of mSWI/SNF ATPase activity attenuates proliferation of all POU2F3-positive SCLCs, while disruption of non-canonical BAF (ncBAF) via BRD9 degradation is effective in pure non-neuroendocrine POU2F3-SCLCs. mSWI/SNF targets to and maintains accessibility over gene loci central to POU2F3-mediated gene regulatory networks. Finally, clinical-grade pharmacologic disruption of SMARCA4/2 ATPases and BRD9 decreases POU2F3-SCLC tumor growth and increases survival in vivo. These results demonstrate mSWI/SNF-mediated governance of the POU2F3 oncogenic program and suggest mSWI/SNF inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for POU2F3-positive SCLCs.",

However, the precise cellular interactions and spatial organizations within the TME that drive these effects remain elusive. Using advanced multiplex imaging techniques, we have discovered that regulatory T cells (Tregs) accumulate around lymphatic vessels in the peripheral tumor stroma. This localized accumulation is facilitated by mature dendritic cells enriched in immunoregulatory molecules (mregDCs), which promote chemotaxis of Tregs, establishing a peri-lymphatic Treg-mregDC niche. Within this niche, mregDCs facilitate Treg activation, which in turn restrains the trafficking of tumor antigens to the draining mesenteric lymph nodes, thereby impeding the initiation of anti-tumor adaptive immune responses.

Increased TH reverses EZH2-mediated repression of NeuroD1 by abrogating the binding of EZH2 and TRα1, thereby stimulating tumor cell differentiation and reducing MB growth. Importantly, TH-induced differentiation of tumor cells is not restricted by the molecular subgroup of MB, suggesting that TH can be used to broadly treat MB subgroups.

However, the immune system’s role in maintaining the normal state of mutated tissues remains uncertain. Herein, we demonstrate that T cell immunity to cutaneotropic papillomaviruses promotes the homeostasis of ultraviolet radiation-damaged skin. Mouse papillomavirus (MmuPV1) colonization blocks the expansion of mutant p53 clones in the epidermis in a CD8+ T cell-dependent manner. MmuPV1 activity is increased in p53-deficient keratinocytes, leading to their specific targeting by CD8+ T cells in the skin. Sun-exposed human skin containing mutant p53 clones shows increased epidermal beta-human papillomavirus (β-HPV) activity and CD8+ T cell infiltrates compared with sun-protected skin. The expansion of mutant p53 clones in premalignant skin lesions associates with β-HPV loss.

To address this, we developed syngeneic models reflecting the genetics, epigenetics, and immunology of human FL and DLBCL. We show that EZH2 inhibitors reprogram these models to re-express T cell engagement genes and render them highly immunogenic. EZH2 inhibitors do not harm tumor-controlling T cells or CAR-T cells. Instead, they reduce regulatory T cells, promote memory chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) CD8 phenotypes, and reduce exhaustion, resulting in a decreased tumor burden. Intravital 2-photon imaging shows increased CAR-T recruitment and interaction within the tumor microenvironment, improving lymphoma cell killing. Therefore, EZH2 inhibition enhances CAR-T cell efficacy through direct effects on CAR-T cells, in addition to rendering lymphoma B cells immunogenic.

Studies using genetically modified NET-deficient mice, pharmacologic inhibition of NETs, and adoptive B cell transfer show that NETs induce expression of the chemoattractant CXCL13 in the pre-metastatic omentum, stimulating recruitment of peritoneal innate-like B cells that in turn promote expansion of regulatory T cells and omental metastasis through producing interleukin (IL)-10.

Blocking circadian signals, like vasoactive intestinal peptide or glucocorticoids, dramatically slows GBM growth and disease progression. Analysis of human GBM samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) shows that high GR expression significantly increases hazard of mortality. Finally, mouse and human GBM models have intrinsic circadian rhythms in clock gene expression in vitro and in vivo that entrain to the host through glucocorticoid signaling, regardless of tumor type or host immune status.

In vivo CRISPR-Cas9 screening of dormancy-associated candidate genes identifies the galactosyltransferase B3GALT6 as a functional regulator of RTC fitness. B3GALT6 is required for glycosaminoglycan (GAG) linkage to proteins to generate proteoglycans, and its germline loss of function in patients causes skeletal dysplasias. We find that B3GALT6-mediated biosynthesis of heparan sulfate GAGs predicts poor patient outcomes and promotes tumor recurrence by enhancing dormant RTC survival in multiple contexts, and does so via a B3GALT6-heparan sulfate/HS6ST1-heparan 6-O-sulfation/FGF1-FGFR2 signaling axis.

Here, we show that epidermal growth factor receptor/Erb-B2 receptor (EGFR/ERBB2) signaling is induced by TGF-β in myCAFs through an autocrine process mediated by amphiregulin. Inhibition of this EGFR/ERBB2-signaling network in PDAC organoid-derived cultures and mouse models differentially impacts distinct CAF subtypes, providing insights into mechanisms underpinning their heterogeneity. Remarkably, EGFR-activated myCAFs promote PDAC metastasis in mice, unmasking functional significance in myCAF heterogeneity. Finally, analyses of other cancer datasets suggest that these processes might operate in other malignancies. These data provide functional relevance to myCAF heterogeneity and identify a candidate target for preventing tumor invasion in PDAC.",

    "abstract": "The period between “successful” treatment of localized breast cancer and the onset of distant metastasis can last many years, representing an unexploited window to eradicate disseminated disease and prevent metastases. We find that the source of recurrence—disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) —evade endogenous immunity directed against tumor neoantigens. Although DTCs downregulate major histocompatibility complex I, this does not preclude recognition by conventional T cells. Instead, the scarcity of interactions between two relatively rare populations—DTCs and endogenous antigen-specific T cells—underlies DTC persistence. This scarcity is overcome by any one of three immunotherapies that increase the number of tumor-specific T cells: T cell-based vaccination, or adoptive transfer of T cell receptor or chimeric antigen receptor T cells. Each approach achieves robust DTC elimination, motivating discovery of MHC-restricted and -unrestricted DTC antigens that can be targeted with T cell-based immunotherapies to eliminate the reservoir of metastasis-initiating cells in patients.",

FX activation within the TME enhances androgen-independent tumor growth by activating the protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) and the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in tumor cells. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of factor Xa (FXa) antagonizes the oncogenic activity of PMN-MDSCs, reduces tumor progression, and synergizes with enzalutamide therapy.

To understand the early stages of brain colonization, we investigated two prevalent sources of cerebral relapse, triple-negative (TNBC) and HER2+ (HER2BC) breast cancers. Using mouse models and human tissue samples, we found that these tumor types colonize the brain, with a preference for distinctive tumor architectures, stromal interfaces, and autocrine programs. TNBC models tend to form perivascular sheaths with diffusive contact with astrocytes and microglia. In contrast, HER2BC models tend to form compact spheroids driven by autonomous tenascin C production, segregating stromal cells to the periphery.

Single Fn administration also potentiates anti-PD-1 efficacy in murine allografts and CD34+-humanized mice bearing MSS CRC.

Here, we discover SLC13A3 is an itaconate transporter in tumor cells and endows tumor ferroptosis resistance, diminishing tumor immunity and ICB efficacy. Mechanistically, tumor cells uptake itaconate via SLC13A3 from tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), thereby activating the NRF2-SLC7A11 pathway and escaping from immune-mediated ferroptosis. Structural modeling and molecular docking analysis identify a functional inhibitor for SLC13A3 (SLC13A3i). Deletion of ACOD1 (an essential enzyme for itaconate synthesis) in macrophages, genetic ablation of SLC13A3 in tumors, or treatment with SLC13A3i sensitize tumors to ferroptosis, curb tumor progression, and bolster ICB effectiveness.

Here, we identify CD49f as a prominent marker for discerning TICs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), outperforming other commonly used TIC markers. CD49f-high TICs specifically recruit tumor-promoting neutrophils via the CXCL2-CXCR2 axis and create an immunosuppressive milieu in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Reciprocally, the neutrophils reprogram nearby tumor cells toward a TIC phenotype via secreting CCL4. These cells can evade CD8+ T cell-mediated killing through CCL4/STAT3-induced and CD49f-stabilized CD155 expression. Notably, while aberrant CD155 expression contributes to immune suppression, it also represents a TIC-specific vulnerability. We demonstrate that either CD155 deletion or antibody blockade significantly enhances sensitivity to anti-PD-1 therapy in preclinical HCC models. Our findings reveal a new mechanism of tumor immune evasion and provide a rationale for combining CD155 blockade with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy in HCC.",

Herein, our study reveals that pericancerous macrophages cross-present antigens to CD103+ CTLs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation machinery-mediated cytosolic pathway. This process leads to the retention of CD103+ CTLs in the pericancerous area, whereby they activate NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages, promoting hepatoma progression and resistance to immunotherapy. Our single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics analysis of HCC patients shows that despite their tissue-resident effector phenotype, the aggregation of CD103+ CTLs predicts unfavorable clinical outcomes for HCC patients receiving multiple types of treatment.

    "abstract": "As an executor of pyroptosis, gasdermin D (GSDMD) plays a critical role in inflammatory diseases and cancer. Thus, GSDMD is currently being widely explored as a drug target. Existing inhibitors targeting GSDMD, such as necrosulfonamide, disulfiram, and fumarate, primarily prevent pyroptosis by modifying human/mouse C191/C192 in the N-terminal fragment of GSDMD. However, cysteine modification can prevent the function of important proteins or enzymes, thereby leading to adverse reactions. Here, we chose an alternative key intervention site for GSDMD activation, which is located at the oligomerization interface I of its pore-forming structure. Through high-throughput virtual and experimental screening and in combination with efficacy and pharmacological validation, we have identified two safe, specific “repurposed drugs” that potently suppress GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis. Moreover, the candidates exhibited synergistic therapeutic effects of “1 + 1>2” in murine sepsis and tumorigenesis models.

Here, we report that tumor cells that express PD-L1 are sensitive to ferroptosis inducers such as imidazole ketone erastin (IKE). PD-L1 promotes ferroptosis sensitivity because it suppresses SLC7A11 expression and diminishes glutathione levels. Although the use of anti-PD-L1 antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) could be effective for the delivery of ferroptosis inducers to specific tumor populations, the chemistry of most ferroptosis inducers precludes their incorporation in ADCs. To overcome this challenge, we synthesized an antibody nanogel conjugate (ANC) comprised of an anti-PD-L1 antibody conjugated to a nanogel encapsulated with IKE. This ANC targets PD-L1-expressing cells in vitro and in vivo and induces ferroptosis, resulting in tumor suppression.

To disentangle these multiple roles of aspartate metabolism, tools are required that measure aspartate concentrations in real time and in live cells. We introduce AspSnFR, a genetically encoded green fluorescent biosensor for intracellular aspartate, engineered through displaying and screening biosensor libraries on mammalian cells. In live cells, AspSnFR is able to precisely and quantitatively measure cytosolic aspartate concentrations and dissect its production from glutamine. Combining high-content imaging of AspSnFR with pharmacological perturbations exposes differences in metabolic vulnerabilities of aspartate levels based on nutrient availability. Further, AspSnFR facilitates tracking of aspartate export from mitochondria through SLC25A12, the MAS’ key transporter. We show that SLC25A12 is a rapidly responding and direct route to couple Ca2+ signaling with mitochondrial aspartate export.

We demonstrate βHB-induced protein insolubility is not dependent on covalent protein modification, pH, or solute load, and is observable in mouse brain in vivo after delivery of a ketone ester. This mechanism is selective for pathological proteins such as amyloid-β, and exogenous βHB ameliorates pathology in nematode models of amyloid-β aggregation toxicity. We generate libraries of the βHB-induced protein insolublome using mass spectrometry proteomics, and identify common protein domains and upstream regulators.

However, a remaining challenge is to unambiguously identify primary TPD targets that are distinct from secondary downstream effects in the proteome. Here we introduce an approach for selective analysis of protein degradation by mass spectrometry (DegMS) at proteomic scale, which derives its specificity from the exclusion of confounding effects of altered transcription and translation induced by target depletion. We show that the approach efficiently operates at the timescale of TPD (hours) and we demonstrate its utility by analyzing the cyclin K degraders dCeMM2 and dCeMM4, which induce widespread transcriptional downregulation, and the GSPT1 degrader CC-885, an inhibitor of protein translation.

These hydrophobic modifications destabilize the repressive CARD8 N-terminal fragment and accelerate its proteasome-mediated degradation, thereby releasing the inflammatory CARD8 C-terminal fragment from autoinhibition. Consistently, we also found that unrelated (non-RTA) hydrophobic electrophiles as well as genetic mutation of the CARD8 cysteine residues to isoleucines similarly potentiate inflammasome activation.

We previously demonstrated that salinipostin A (SalA), a natural product, potently kills parasites by inhibiting multiple lipid metabolizing serine hydrolases, a mechanism that results in a low propensity for resistance. Given the difficulty of employing natural products as therapeutic agents, we synthesized a small library of lipidic mixed alkyl/aryl phosphonates as bioisosteres of SalA. Two constitutional isomers exhibited divergent antiparasitic potencies that enabled the identification of therapeutically relevant targets. The active compound kills parasites through a mechanism that is distinct from both SalA and the pan-lipase inhibitor orlistat and shows synergistic killing with orlistat.

    "abstract": "Ferroptosis is a form of cell death caused by lipid peroxidation that is emerging as a target for cancer therapy, highlighting the need to identify factors that govern ferroptosis susceptibility. Lipid peroxidation occurs primarily on phospholipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Here, we show that even though extracellular lipid limitation reduces cellular PUFA levels, lipid-starved cancer cells are paradoxically more sensitive to ferroptosis. Using mass spectrometry-based lipidomics with stable isotope fatty acid labeling, we show that lipid limitation induces a fatty acid trafficking pathway in which PUFAs are liberated from triglycerides to synthesize highly unsaturated PUFAs such as arachidonic and adrenic acid. These PUFAs then accumulate in phospholipids, including ether phospholipids, to promote ferroptosis sensitivity. Therefore, PUFA levels within cancer cells do not necessarily correlate with ferroptosis susceptibility. Rather, how cancer cells respond to extracellular lipid levels by trafficking PUFAs into proper phospholipid pools contributes to their sensitivity to ferroptosis.",

Many pathogenic and oncogenic viruses encode E3 ligases (vE3s), which de facto have strictly limited expression to diseased cells. Here, we provide proof-of-concept for viral E3 pan-essential removing targeting chimeras (VIPER-TACs) that are bi-functional molecules that utilize viral E3 ubiquitin ligases to selectively degrade pan-essential proteins and eliminate diseased cells. We find that the human papillomavirus (HPV) ligase E6 can degrade the SARS1 pan-essential target protein in a model of HPV-positive cervical cancer to selectively kill E6 expressing cancer cells.

    "abstract": "CDK9 coordinates signaling events that regulate transcription and is implicated in oncogenic pathways, making it an actionable target for drug development. While numerous CDK9 inhibitors have been developed, success in the clinic has been limited. Targeted degradation offers a promising alternative. A comprehensive evaluation of degradation versus inhibition is needed to assess when degradation might offer superior therapeutic outcomes. We report a selective and potent CDK9 degrader with rapid kinetics, comparing its downstream effects to those of a conventional inhibitor. We validated that CDK9 inhibition triggers a compensatory feedback mechanism that dampens its anticipated effect on MYC expression and found that this was absent when degraded. Importantly, degradation is more effective at disrupting MYC transcriptional regulation and subsequently destabilizing nucleolar homeostasis, likely by abrogation of both enzymatic and scaffolding functions of CDK9. These findings suggest that CDK9 degradation offers a more robust strategy to overcome limitations associated with its inhibition.",

The developmental-stage-specific divergence of exon 10 splicing, whose dysregulation can cause frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), is mediated by divergent distal intronic MBNL-binding sites. Competitive binding of these sites by CRISPR-dCas13d/gRNAs effectively reduces exon 10 inclusion, potentially providing a therapeutically compatible approach to modulate tau isoform expression.

    "abstract": "Mushroom-forming fungi (Agaricomycetes) are emerging as pivotal players in several fields of science and industry. Genomic data for Agaricomycetes are accumulating rapidly; however, this is not paralleled by improvements of gene annotations, which leave gene function notoriously poorly understood. We set out to improve our functional understanding of the model mushroom Coprinopsis cinerea by integrating a new, chromosome-level assembly, high-quality gene predictions, and functional information derived from broad gene-expression profiling data. The new annotation includes 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs), polyadenylation sites (PASs), upstream open reading frames (uORFs), splicing isoforms, and microexons, as well as core gene sets corresponding to carbon starvation, light response, and hyphal differentiation. As a result, the genome of C. cinerea has now become the most comprehensively annotated genome among mushroom-forming fungi, which will contribute to multiple rapidly expanding fields, including research on their life history, light and stress responses, as well as multicellular development.",

    "abstract": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) and other autoimmune diseases (AIDs) often co-occur in families. Leveraging data from 58,284 family trios in Finnish nationwide registers (FinRegistry), we identified that, of 50 parental AIDs examined, 15 were associated with an increased T1D risk in offspring. These identified epidemiological associations were further assessed in 470,000 genotyped Finns from the FinnGen study through comprehensive genetic analyses, partitioned into human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and non-HLA variations. Using FinnGen’s 12,563 trios, a within-family polygenic transmission analysis demonstrated that the aggregation of many parental AIDs with offspring T1D can be partially explained by HLA and non-HLA polymorphisms in a disease-dependent manner. We therefore proposed a parental polygenic score (PGS), incorporating both HLA and non-HLA polymorphisms, to characterize the cumulative risk pattern of T1D in offspring.

RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) gradually initiates ZGA in mice, but regulation in late-ZGA species remains unclear. Here, RNA Pol II profiling in bovine embryos identified strong intergenic clusters that boost minor ZGA gene expression via chromatin interactions and are named super RNA Pol II domains (SPDs). CRISPRi perturbation of SPDs in bovine embryos decreases the expression of minor ZGA genes, whereas the knockdown of these genes disrupts major ZGA and embryogenesis. Rapid enhancement of minor ZGA genes also occurs in human embryos. Alternatively, mouse and porcine oocytes precociously express these minor ZGA genes without SPDs.

We employed direct-capture Perturb-seq to assess the transcriptional consequences and viability of each SDL perturbation at a single-cell resolution. This revealed IGF2BP2 as a critical genetic dependency that, when targeted, downregulated PLK1 and significantly restricted tumor growth.

By single-cell RNA sequencing and comprehensive functional studies, we demonstrated that MCUR1 depletion leads to impairment of erythropoiesis under hypoxia and normoxia. Mechanistically, MCUR1 knockdown reduced mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and then concomitantly increased cytosolic Ca2+ levels, which thereby reduced erythropoiesis via the CAMKK2-AMPK-mTOR axis. Further, we revealed rs61644582 at 6p23 as an expression quantitative trait locus for MCUR1 and a functional variant that confers an allele-specific transcriptional regulation of MCUR1.

Here, we bridge this gap by analyzing the transcriptomes of a large diallel panel consisting of 323 unique hybrids originating from genetically divergent Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolates. Our analysis across 5,087 transcript abundance traits showed that non-additive components account for 36% of the gene expression variance on average. By comparing allele-specific read counts in parent-hybrid trios, we found that trans-regulatory changes underlie the majority of gene expression variation in the population. Remarkably, most cis-regulatory variations are also exaggerated or attenuated by additional trans effects.

In males the 46th chromosome is a Y; in females it is an “inactive” X (Xi). Through linear modeling of autosomal gene expression in cells from individuals with zero to three Xi and zero to four Y chromosomes, we found that Xi and Y impact autosomal expression broadly and with remarkably similar effects. Studying sex chromosome structural anomalies, promoters of Xi- and Y-responsive genes, and CRISPR inhibition, we traced part of this shared effect to homologous transcription factors—ZFX and ZFY—encoded by Chr X and Y. This demonstrates sex-shared mechanisms by which Xi and Y modulate autosomal expression.

Here, we show that PBRM1’s gene regulatory roles differ drastically between cell states, leveraging human skin epithelium (epidermis) as a research platform. In progenitors, PBRM1 predominantly functions to repress terminal differentiation to sustain progenitors’ regenerative potential; in the differentiation state, however, PBRM1 switches toward an activator. Between these two cell states, PBRM1 retains its genomic binding but associates with differential interacting proteins. Our targeted screen identified the E3 SUMO ligase PIAS1 as a key interactor. PIAS1 co-localizes with PBRM1 on chromatin to directly repress differentiation genes in progenitors, and PIAS1’s chromatin binding drastically diminishes in differentiation. Furthermore, SUMOylation contributes to PBRM1’s repressive function in progenitor maintenance.

P-TEAM was able to accurately classify T cell reactivities and quantitatively predict T cell functionalities for unobserved single-point mutations and unseen TCRs. Overall, P-TEAM provides an effective computational tool to study T cell responses against mutated epitopes.",

Over 150 non-coding risk variants for asthma have been identified, many affecting gene regulation in T cells, but the effects of most risk variants remain unknown. We hypothesized that airway epithelial cells could also mediate genetic susceptibility to asthma given they are the first line of defense against respiratory viruses and allergens. We integrated genetic data with transcriptomics of airway epithelial cells subject to different stimuli. We demonstrate that rhinovirus infection significantly upregulates childhood-onset asthma-associated genes, particularly in non-ciliated cells. This enrichment is also observed with influenza infection but not with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or cytokine activation.

We find that staphylococcal lactate is a metabolic danger signal that triggers neutrophil extracellular trap release (NETosis). Neutrophils coordinate mitochondria in proximity to S. aureus-containing phagosomes, allowing transfer of staphylococcal lactate to mitochondria where it is rapidly converted into pyruvate and causes mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, a precursor to NETosis. Similar results were observed in response to phylogenetically distinct bacteria, implicating lactate accumulation as a broad signal triggering NETosis. Furthermore, patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are more susceptible to bacterial infections.

Pathogen clearance is linked to enteropathy severity and subsequent recruitment of intraluminal neutrophils, which differs in a microbiota-dependent manner. By combining mouse knockout and antibody-mediated depletion models with bacterial genetics, we show that neutrophils and host-derived reactive oxygen species directly influence E. coli-mediated S.

    "abstract": "The intestine and liver are thought to metabolize dietary nutrients and regulate host nutrient homeostasis. Here, we find that the gut microbiota also reshapes the host amino acid (aa) landscape via efficiently metabolizing intestinal aa. To identify the responsible microbes/genes, we developed a metabolomics-based assay to screen 104 commensals and identified candidates that efficiently utilize aa. Using genetics, we identified multiple responsible metabolic genes in phylogenetically diverse microbes. By colonizing germ-free mice with the wild-type strain and their isogenic mutant deficient in individual aa-metabolizing genes, we found that these genes regulate the availability of gut and circulatory aa. Notably, microbiota genes for branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and tryptophan metabolism indirectly affect host glucose homeostasis via peripheral serotonin. Collectively, at single-gene level, this work characterizes a microbiota-encoded metabolic activity that affects host nutrient homeostasis and provides a roadmap to interrogate microbiota-dependent activity to improve human health.",

Dynamin-2 recruitment to the membrane near a bacterium was followed by a short burst of T6SS-5 activity. This resulted in the polymerization of the actin of the newly invaded host cell and disruption of the protrusion membrane. Most protrusion lysis events were dependent on dynamin activity, caused no cell-cell fusion, and failed to be recognized by galectin-3. T6SS-5 inactivation decreased protrusion lysis but increased galectin-3, LC3, and LAMP1 accumulation in host cells.

Here, we show that TaHRC alleles distinctly drive liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) within a proteinaceous complex, determining FHB susceptibility or resistance. TaHRC-S (susceptible) exhibits stronger LLPS ability than TaHRC-R (resistant), and this distinction is further intensified by fungal mycotoxin deoxynivalenol, leading to opposing FHB symptoms. TaHRC recruits a protein class with intrinsic LLPS potentials, referred to as an “HRC-containing hub.” TaHRC-S drives condensation of hub components, while TaHRC-R comparatively suppresses hub condensate formation. The function of TaSR45a splicing factor, a hub member, depends on TaHRC-driven condensate state, which in turn differentially directs alternative splicing, switching between susceptibility and resistance to wheat FHB.

Phages can produce communication molecules of their own, or “listen in” on the host’s communication processes, to switch between lytic and lysogenic modes of infection. Here, we study the interaction of Vibrio cholerae with the lysogenic phage VP882, which is activated by the QS molecule DPO. We discover that induction of VP882 results in the binding of phage transcripts to the major RNA chaperone Hfq, which in turn outcompetes and downregulates host-encoded small RNAs (sRNAs). VP882 itself also encodes Hfq-binding sRNAs, and we demonstrate that one of these sRNAs, named VpdS, promotes phage replication by regulating host and phage mRNA levels.

Using Bacteroides, we show that Bte1 is active in the mammalian gut, conferring a fitness advantage to expressing strains. Recipient cells targeted by Bte1 exhibit sensitivity to membrane-compromising conditions, and human gut microbes can use this effector to exploit pathogen-induced inflammation in the gut.

We find that a low-fiber diet increases MHC-II expression in the colonic epithelium, which, in turn, worsens CDI by promoting the development of pathogenic CD4+ intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs). The influence of dietary fibers on MHC-II expression is mediated by its metabolic product, acetate, and its receptor, free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2). While acetate activation of FFAR2 on epithelial cells helps resist CDI, it does not directly regulate MHC-II expression. Instead, MHC-II is regulated by FFAR2 in type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s). Acetate enhances interleukin-22 (IL-22) production by ILC3s, which then suppresses MHC-II expression on the colonic epithelium. In conclusion, a low-fiber diet reduces acetate-induced IL-22 production by ILC3s, leading to increased MHC-II on the colonic epithelium.

    "abstract": "Evidence suggests that bats are important hosts of filoviruses, yet the specific species involved remain largely unidentified. Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) is an essential entry receptor, with amino acid variations influencing viral susceptibility and species-specific tropism. Herein, we conducted combinatorial binding studies with seven filovirus glycoproteins (GPs) and NPC1 orthologs from 81 bat species. We found that GP-NPC1 binding correlated poorly with phylogeny. By integrating binding assays with machine learning, we identified genetic factors influencing virus-receptor-binding and predicted GP-NPC1-binding avidity for additional filoviruses and bats. Moreover, combining receptor-binding avidities with bat geographic distribution and the locations of previous Ebola outbreaks allowed us to rank bats by their potential as Ebola virus hosts. This study represents a comprehensive investigation of filovirus-receptor binding in bats (1,484 GP-NPC1 pairs, 11 filoviruses, and 135 bats) and describes a multidisciplinary approach to predict susceptible species and guide filovirus host surveillance.",

    "abstract": "Cytotoxic chemotherapies have devastating side effects, particularly within the gastrointestinal tract. Gastrointestinal toxicity includes the death and damage of the epithelium and an imbalance in the intestinal microbiota, otherwise known as dysbiosis. Whether dysbiosis is a direct contributor to tissue toxicity is a key area of focus. Here, from both mammalian and bacterial perspectives, we uncover an intestinal epithelial cell death-Enterobacteriaceae signaling axis that fuels dysbiosis. Specifically, our data demonstrate that chemotherapy-induced epithelial cell apoptosis and the purine-containing metabolites released from dying cells drive the inter-kingdom transcriptional re-wiring of the Enterobacteriaceae, including fundamental shifts in bacterial respiration and promotion of purine utilization-dependent expansion, which in turn delays the recovery of the intestinal tract. Inhibition of epithelial cell death or restriction of the Enterobacteriaceae to homeostatic levels reverses dysbiosis and improves intestinal recovery.

Accordingly, we developed a probiotic-based therapeutic that synergistically restores intestinal redox and microbiota homeostasis.

Upon oral administration, the selenium dot-embedded pericellular film efficiently enhanced gastric acid resistance and intestinal mucoadhesion of Lac cells.

Traditionally, masking immunogenic moieties has been viewed as a tactic for immune evasion. Here, we demonstrate that C. albicans blocks type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling via translocating an effector protein Cmi1 into host cells. Mechanistically, Cmi1 binds and inhibits TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) to abrogate IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation, thereby suppressing the IFN-I cascade. Murine infection with a cmi1 mutant displays an exaggerated IFN-I response in both kidneys and bone-marrow-derived macrophages, leading to rapid fungal clearance and host survival. Remarkably, the lack of CMI1 compromises gut commensalism and increases IFN-I response in mouse colonic cells. These phenotypes of cmi1 are rescued by the depletion of IFN-I receptor.

However, its genetic and molecular basis remains largely unknown. Here, we discovered that protein condensation at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) regulates disease tolerance in Arabidopsis against Pseudomonas syringae. During infection, Hematopoietic protein-1 (HEM1) and Bax-inhibitor 1 (BI-1) coalesce into ER-associated condensates facilitated by their phase-separation behaviors. While BI-1 aids in clearing these condensates via autophagy, it also sequesters lipid-metabolic enzymes within condensates, likely disturbing lipid homeostasis. Consequently, mutations in hem1, which hinder condensate formation, or in bi-1, which prevent enzyme entrapment, enhance tissue-damage resilience, and preserve overall plant health during infection.

Such protection, which also applied to respiratory syncytial virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was independent of interferon and adaptive immunity but required basally resident alveolar macrophages (AMs). In SFB-negative mice, AMs were quickly depleted as RVI progressed. In contrast, AMs from SFB-colonized mice were intrinsically altered to resist IAV-induced depletion and inflammatory signaling. Yet, AMs from SFB-colonized mice were not quiescent. Rather, they directly disabled IAV via enhanced complement production and phagocytosis. Accordingly, transfer of SFB-transformed AMs into SFB-free hosts recapitulated SFB-mediated protection against IAV.

Gut microbiota has been linked to the development of hyperuricemia through unclear mechanisms. Here, we show that the abundance and centrality of Alistipes indistinctus are depleted in subjects with hyperuricemia. Integrative metagenomic and metabolomic analysis identified hippuric acid as the key microbial effector that mediates the uric-acid-lowering effect of A. indistinctus. Mechanistically, A. indistinctus-derived hippuric acid enhances the binding of peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) to the promoter of ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2), which in turn boosts intestinal urate excretion. To facilitate this enhanced excretion, hippuric acid also promotes ABCG2 localization to the brush border membranes in a PDZ-domain-containing 1 (PDZK1)-dependent manner. These findings indicate that A. indistinctus and hippuric acid promote intestinal urate excretion and offer insights into microbiota-host crosstalk in the maintenance of uric acid homeostasis.",

In this study, we assess whether SYNB1353, an E. coli Nissle 1917 derivative, impacts circulating methionine and homocysteine levels in animals and healthy volunteers. In both mice and nonhuman primates (NHPs), SYNB1353 blunts the appearance of plasma methionine and plasma homocysteine in response to an oral methionine load. A phase 1 clinical study conducted in healthy volunteers subjected to an oral methionine challenge demonstrates that SYNB1353 is well tolerated and blunts plasma methionine by 26%.

To maintain cellular energetics during periods of oxidative stress, intracellular Salmonella must utilize terminal electron acceptors of lower energetic value than molecular oxygen. We show here that intracellular Salmonella undergoes anaerobic respiration during adaptation to the respiratory burst of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase in macrophages and in mice. Reactive oxygen species generated by phagocytes oxidize methionine, generating methionine sulfoxide. Anaerobic Salmonella uses the molybdenum cofactor-containing DmsABC enzymatic complex to reduce methionine sulfoxide. The enzymatic activity of the methionine sulfoxide reductase DmsABC helps Salmonella maintain an alkaline cytoplasm that supports the synthesis of the antioxidant hydrogen sulfide via cysteine desulfuration while providing a source of methionine and fostering redox balancing by associated dehydrogenases.

PA binding enhances RBOHD protein stability by inhibiting vacuolar degradation, thereby increasing chitin-induced ROS production. Mutations in diacylglycerol kinase 5 (DGK5), which phosphorylates diacylglycerol to produce PA, impair chitin-induced PA and ROS production. The DGK5 transcript DGK5β (but not DGK5α) complements reduced PA and ROS production in dgk5-1 mutants, as well as resistance to Botrytis cinerea.

We identified that Bacteroides fragilis is enriched in patients with CRC resistant to chemotherapy in two independent cohorts, and its abundance is associated with poor survival. Consistently, administration of B. fragilis to CRC xenografts and ApcMin/+- and AOM/DSS-induced CRC mice all significantly attenuated the antitumor efficacy of 5-FU and OXA. Mechanistically, B. fragilis colonized colon tumors and mediated its effect via its surface protein SusD/RagB binding to the Notch1 receptor in CRC cells, leading to activation of the Notch1 signaling pathway and the induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)/stemness to suppress chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Either deletion of SusD/RagB or blockade of Notch1 signaling abrogated B. fragilis-mediated chemoresistance. Finally, B. fragilis-targeting phage VA7 selectively suppressed B. fragilis and restored chemosensitivity in preclinical CRC mouse models.

The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a master regulator of BA homeostasis via the ileal fibroblast growth factor (FGF)15/19 endocrine pathway, responding to postprandial or abnormal transintestinal BA flux. However, the de novo paracrine signal mediator of hepatic FXR, which governs the extent of BA synthesis within the liver in non-postprandial or intrahepatic cholestatic conditions, remains unknown. We identified hepatic Fgf4 as a direct FXR target that paracrinally signals to downregulate Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1. The effect of FXR-FGF4 is mediated by an uncharted intracellular FGF receptor 4 (FGFR4)-LRH-1 signaling node. This liver-centric pathway acts as a first-line checkpoint for intrahepatic and transhepatic BA flux upstream of the peripheral FXR-FGF15/19 pathway, which together constitutes an integral hepatoenteric control mechanism that fine-tunes BA homeostasis, counteracting cholestasis and hepatobiliary damage.

Overnutrition rapidly increases plasma norepinephrine (NE), suggesting overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). However, the role of the SNS in obesity is controversial, as both increased and decreased SNS activity (SNA) have been reported. Here, we show that reducing catecholamine (CA) release from the SNS protects against overnutrition-induced insulin resistance as well as hyperglucagonemia, adipose tissue dysfunction, and fatty liver disease, as we demonstrate utilizing a mouse model of inducible and peripherally restricted deletion of tyrosine hydroxylase (th; THΔper).

Microbial depletion disturbs the brain transcriptome and metabolome in stress-responding pathways in the hippocampus and amygdala across the day. This is coupled with a dysregulation of the circadian pacemaker in the brain that results in perturbed glucocorticoid rhythmicity. The resulting hyper-activation of the HPA axis at the sleep/wake transition drives time-of-day-specific impairments of the stress response and stress-sensitive behaviors. Finally, microbiota transplantation confirmed that diurnal oscillations of gut microbes underlie altered glucocorticoid secretion and that L. reuteri is a candidate strain for such effects.

We show that GIPR induction in the fat cell protects mice from diet-induced obesity and triggers profound weight loss (∼35%) in an obese setting. Adipose GIPR further increases lipid oxidation, thermogenesis, and energy expenditure. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that GIPR induction activates SERCA-mediated futile calcium cycling in the adipocyte.

Cerebral norepinephrine (NE) plays a key role in promoting wakefulness, but how does the brain avoid neuronal hyperexcitability upon arousal? Here, we show that NE exposure results in the generation of free fatty acids (FFAs) within the plasma membrane from both astrocytes and neurons. In turn, FFAs dampen excitability by differentially modulating the activity of astrocytic and neuronal Na+, K+, ATPase. Direct application of FFA to the occipital cortex in awake, behaving mice dampened visual-evoked potentials (VEPs). Conversely, blocking FFA production via local application of a lipase inhibitor heightened VEP and triggered seizure-like activity.

    "abstract": "ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) synthesizes acetyl-CoA for de novo lipogenesis (DNL), which is elevated in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. Hepatic ACLY is inhibited by the LDL-cholesterol-lowering drug bempedoic acid (BPA), which also improves steatosis in mice. While BPA potently suppresses hepatic DNL and increases fat catabolism, it is unclear if ACLY is its primary molecular target in reducing liver triglyceride. We show that on a Western diet, loss of hepatic ACLY alone or together with the acetyl-CoA synthetase ACSS2 unexpectedly exacerbates steatosis, linked to reduced PPARα target gene expression and fatty acid oxidation. Importantly, BPA treatment ameliorates Western diet-mediated triacylglyceride accumulation in both WT and liver ACLY knockout mice, indicating that its primary effects on hepatic steatosis are ACLY independent. Together, these data indicate that hepatic ACLY plays an unexpected role in restraining diet-dependent lipid accumulation and that BPA exerts substantial effects on hepatic lipid metabolism independently of ACLY.",

IgG activates macrophages via Ras signaling and consequently induces fibrosis in WAT through the TGF-β/SMAD pathway. Consistently, B cell null mice are protected from aging-associated WAT fibrosis, inflammation, and insulin resistance, unless exposed to IgG. Conditional ablation of the IgG recycling receptor, neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), in macrophages prevents IgG accumulation in aging, resulting in prolonged healthspan and lifespan.

    "title": "ACSS2 acts as a lactyl-CoA synthetase and couples KAT2A to function as a lactyltransferase for histone lactylation and tumor immune evasion",
    "abstract": "Lactyl-coenzyme A (CoA)-dependent histone lysine lactylation impacts gene expression and plays fundamental roles in biological processes. However, mammalian lactyl-CoA synthetases and their regulation of histone lactylation have not yet been identified. Here, we demonstrate that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation induces extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-mediated S267 phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2) and its subsequent nuclear translocation and complex formation with lysine acetyltransferase 2A (KAT2A). Importantly, ACSS2 functions as a bona fide lactyl-CoA synthetase and converts lactate to lactyl-CoA, which binds to KAT2A as demonstrated by a co-crystal structure analysis. Consequently, KAT2A acts as a lactyltransferase to lactylate histone H3, leading to the expression of Wnt/β-catenin, NF-κB, and PD-L1 and brain tumor growth and immune evasion. A combination treatment with an ACSS2-KAT2A interaction-blocking peptide and an anti-PD-1 antibody induces an additive tumor-inhibitory effect. These findings uncover ACSS2 and KAT2A as hitherto unidentified lactyl-CoA synthetase and lactyltransferase, respectively, and the significance of the ACSS2-KAT2A coupling in gene expression and tumor development.",

Nevertheless, the mechanism by which cells use L-lactate to generate lactyl-coenzyme A (CoA) and how this process is regulated remains unknown. Here, we report the identification of guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-specific SCS (GTPSCS) as a lactyl-CoA synthetase in the nucleus. The mechanism was elucidated through the crystallographic structure of GTPSCS in complex with L-lactate, followed by mutagenesis experiments. GTPSCS translocates into the nucleus and interacts with p300 to elevate histone lactylation but not succinylation. This process depends on a nuclear localization signal in the GTPSCS G1 subunit and acetylation at G2 subunit residue K73, which mediates the interaction with p300. GTPSCS/p300 collaboration synergistically regulates histone H3K18la and GDF15 expression, promoting glioma proliferation and radioresistance.

In utero circadian desynchrony altered the phase-relationship between the mother and fetus and impacted placental efficiency.

Here, we report that heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2B1 (hnRNPA2B1) is a sensor for metabolite adenine to launch an antimicrobial innate response through increasing Il1b transcription. Myeloid cell-specific Hnrnpa2b1-cKO mice are more susceptible to bacterial infection, while interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) supplementation rescues the phenotype. Through a large-scale metabolites-hnRNPA2B1 interaction screen, we reveal that adenine directly binds and activates hnRNPA2B1 to mediate innate antibacterial response. Mechanistically, adenine directly recruits hnRNPA2B1 to Il1b enhancers, and hnRNPA2B1 increases Il1b enhancer chromatin accessibility through binding and recruiting nucleolin and fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) to mediate Il1b enhancer DNA N6-methyladenosine (6mA) demethylation. Furthermore, bacterial infection elevates nuclear adenine at the early stage of infection, and in vivo adenine administration protects mice from death upon bacterial infection through the hnRNPA2B1-IL-1β circuit.

Brown fat from mice with inducible brown-adipocyte-specific deletion of ATGL and HSL (BAHKO) is hypertrophied with increased lipid droplet size and preserved mitochondria area and density.

Here, we show that genetic perturbations in mammalian ETC complex III (CIII) biogenesis stimulate the formation of a specialized extra-large SC (SC-XL) with a structure of I2+III2, resolved at 3.7 Å by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM). SC-XL formation increases mitochondrial cristae density, reduces CIII reactive oxygen species (ROS), and sustains normal respiration despite a 70% reduction in CIII activity, effectively rescuing CIII deficiency. Consequently, inhibiting SC-XL formation in CIII mutants using the Uqcrc1DEL:E258-D260 contact site mutation leads to respiratory decompensation. Lastly, SC-XL formation promotes fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and protects against ischemic heart failure in mice. Our study uncovers an unexpected plasticity in the mammalian ETC, where structural adaptations mitigate intrinsic perturbations, and suggests that manipulating SC-XL formation is a potential therapeutic strategy for mitochondrial dysfunction.",

Targeting DNA methylation by depletion or pharmacological inhibition of DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) exacerbates cachexia, while restoring DNMT3A expression or REDD1 knockout alleviates cancer cachexia-induced skeletal muscle atrophy in mice. Methionine supplementation restores DNA methylation of the Ddit4 promoter in a DNMT3A-dependent manner, thereby inhibiting activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4)-mediated Ddit4 transcription.

Instead, it serves as a signal molecule to promote the interaction between hexokinase 2 and inositol 1,4,5-trisphophate receptor type 3, the predominant Ca2+ channel on the endoplasmic reticulum.

To investigate this, we generated a mouse model in which nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT)-mediated NAD+ biosynthesis was disrupted in adult skeletal muscle. The intervention resulted in an 85% reduction in muscle NAD+ abundance while maintaining tissue integrity and functionality, as demonstrated by preserved muscle morphology, contractility, and exercise tolerance. This absence of functional impairments was further supported by intact mitochondrial respiratory capacity and unaltered muscle transcriptomic and proteomic profiles.

This effect is mediated by fasting-induced ketogenesis and could be alternatively implemented by combination therapy with antibiotics and ketone bodies.

Serum NaR levels decline with aging, whereas oral NaR supplementation in aged mice boosts serum nicotinamide and multi-organ NAD+, including kidneys, and reduces kidney inflammation and albuminuria.

    "abstract": "Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, but its pathophysiology remains unclear. Here, we report a mouse model of HFpEF and show that hexokinase (HK)-1 mitochondrial binding in endothelial cells (ECs) is critical for protein O-GlcNAcylation and the development of HFpEF. We demonstrate increased mitochondrial dislocation of HK1 within ECs in HFpEF mice. Mice with deletion of the mitochondrial-binding domain of HK1 spontaneously develop HFpEF and display impaired angiogenesis. Spatial proximity of dislocated HK1 and O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT) causes increased OGT activity, shifting the balance of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway intermediates into the O-GlcNAcylation machinery. EC-specific overexpression of O-GlcNAcase and an OGT inhibitor reverse angiogenic defects and the HFpEF phenotype, highlighting the importance of protein O-GlcNAcylation in the development of HFpEF. Our study demonstrates a new mechanism for HFpEF through HK1 cellular localization and resultant protein O-GlcNAcylation, and provides a potential therapy for HFpEF.",

    "abstract": "Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are more susceptible to severe respiratory viral infections, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we show that patients with T2D and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections, and influenza-infected T2D mice, exhibit defective T helper 1 (Th1) responses, which are an essential component of anti-viral immunity. This defect stems from intrinsic metabolic perturbations in CD4+ T cells driven by hyperglycemia. Mechanistically, hyperglycemia triggers mitochondrial dysfunction and excessive fatty acid synthesis, leading to elevated oxidative stress and aberrant lipid accumulation within CD4+ T cells. These abnormalities promote lipid peroxidation (LPO), which drives carbonylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (STAT4), a crucial Th1-lineage-determining factor. Carbonylated STAT4 undergoes rapid degradation, causing reduced T-bet induction and diminished Th1 differentiation. LPO scavenger ameliorates Th1 defects in patients with T2D who have poor glycemic control and restores viral control in T2D mice. Thus, this hyperglycemia-LPO-STAT4 axis underpins reduced Th1 activity in T2D hosts, with important implications for managing T2D-related viral complications.",

The mechanisms of regulation of mtDNA copy number and expression are not completely understood but crucially ensure the correct stoichiometric assembly of OXPHOS complexes from nuclear- and mtDNA-encoded subunits. Here, we detect adenosine N6-methylation (6mA) on the mtDNA of diverse animal and plant species. This modification is regulated in C. elegans by the DNA methyltransferase DAMT-1 and demethylase ALKB-1. Misregulation of mtDNA 6mA through targeted modulation of these activities inappropriately alters mtDNA copy number and transcript levels, impairing OXPHOS function, elevating oxidative stress, and shortening lifespan. Compounding these defects, mtDNA 6mA hypomethylation promotes the cross-generational propagation of a deleterious mtDNA.

Understanding the mechanisms underlying such resistance in these patients is crucial for the development of new treatments. Here, we show that the interaction between ALDH1A3 and PKM2 enhances the latter’s tetramerization and promotes lactate accumulation in glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). By scanning the lactylated proteome in lactate-accumulating GSCs, we show that XRCC1 undergoes lactylation at lysine 247 (K247). Lactylated XRCC1 shows a stronger affinity for importin α, allowing for greater nuclear transposition of XRCC1 and enhanced DNA repair.

While prior studies identified specific metabolic dependencies, systematic insights remain limited. Here, we build a graph deep learning-based metabolic vulnerability prediction model, “DeepMeta,” which can accurately predict the dependent metabolic genes for cancer samples based on transcriptome and metabolic network information. The performance of DeepMeta has been extensively validated with independent datasets. The metabolic vulnerability of “undruggable” cancer-driving alterations has been systematically explored using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. Notably, CTNNB1 T41A-activating mutations showed experimentally confirmed vulnerability to purine/pyrimidine metabolism inhibition. TCGA patients with the predicted pyrimidine metabolism dependency show a dramatically improved clinical response to chemotherapeutic drugs that block this pyrimidine metabolism pathway. This study systematically uncovers the metabolic dependency of cancer cells and provides metabolic targets for cancers driven by genetic alterations that are originally undruggable on their own.",

This study uncovered the potential effects of a fructose metabolite, acetate, on the transcriptional regulation of MYCN expression, which is still largely unexplored. We elucidated the pivotal role of acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) synthetase short-chain family member 2 (ACSS2), found to be heightened in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma. We demonstrated that ACSS2 enhanced MYCN gene transcription and growth of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma. Our results revealed a new mechanism wherein ACSS2 orchestrates MYCN transcription by escalating acetyl-CoA levels and histone acetylation, hinting at a metabolic participation in forcibly dictating MYCN regulation. We further demonstrated that fructose or acetate exacerbated neuroblastoma growth, which can be halted by the ACSS2 inhibitor. We further identified the Nogo-B receptor (NgBR) as the trigger for ACSS2 induction through the Akt-SREBP-1 pathway.

The most common CAR-T cell products currently in the clinic for DLBCL differ in their co-stimulation moiety, containing either CD28 or 4-1BB, which initiate distinct signaling pathways. Previous work has highlighted the importance of T cell metabolism in fueling anti-cancer function. We have studied the metabolic characteristics induced by CD28 versus 4-1BB co-stimulation in patient CAR-T cells ex vivo. Our data show that in patients, CD28 and 4-1BB drive significantly divergent metabolic profiles. CD28 signaling endows T cells with preferentially glycolytic metabolism supporting an effector phenotype and increased expansion capacity, while 4-1BB co-stimulation preserves mitochondrial fitness and results in memory-like differentiation.

Here, we report that Mist1+ cells are resistant to oxidative-stress-induced cell death and that persistent oxidative stress and Kras mutation act in Knudson’s “two-hit” paradigm to promote gastric cancer initiation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation causes metaplastic lineage expansion of Mist1+ cells, licensing them as a cellular origin of gastric cancer. Mechanistically, the transcription factor Mist1 upregulates its downstream target genes Bnip3 and Tmed6, enhancing ROS resistance. Persistent ROS induce R-loop accumulation and activate YAP signaling in Mist1+ cells for proliferation and tumorigenesis. Importantly, ROS and Kras mutation synergistically drive the malignant transformation of Mist1+ cells, while ROS or Kras mutation alone could not do so.

Using a combination of cancer cell lines in complex matrices, mouse xenografts, patient databases, and tissue microarrays, we show that SLC7A11 is highly expressed in amoeboid cancer cells, at the invasive front of primary tumors, and in metastatic lesions.

This insight shifts the paradigm, highlighting RCoR2 as a key determinant of the NB chromatin landscape. Our findings demonstrate that RCoR2 is a super-enhancer-driven gene, which, unlike RCoR1, acts as a positive regulator of gene expression as a partner of the adrenergic NB core regulatory circuitry (CRC). We propose a model in which RCoR2 facilitates interactions between CRC-bound enhancers and their associated transcription start sites, thereby sustaining the expression of genes critical for NB cell survival.

However, the origin of circulating ILC2s and their relationship with ILC progenitors and tissue-resident ILC2s remain unresolved. Single-cell RNA-sequencing and trajectory analysis of ILC2 and ILC2 progenitors in the lung, bone marrow (BM), and intestine draining lymph nodes (LNs) revealed that circulating ILC2s in the lung mirror a population of ILC2s in the mesenteric LNs. Conversely, lung-resident ILC2s closely resembled BM ILC progenitors. These BM progenitors gave rise to lung-resident ILC2s but not circulating ILC2s after adoptive transfer. Definitive proof of an intestinal origin for circulating ILC2s in the lung was achieved through in vivo photoconversion of the intestine.

We also identify endolysosomal factors encoded by Ras-associated binding protein 21 (RAB21) and members of the CCC (COMMD/CCDC22/CCDC93) and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein and SCAR homolog (WASH) complexes as modulators of SIRPA expression. Surface immunophenotyping and surfaceome profiling show that inactivation of either Sirpa or Rab21 remodels cell surface protein expression. In contrast to Sirpa, Rab21 appears to be a general regulator of established macrophage cell surface markers. Perturbation of RAB21/Rab21 reduced Fc gamma receptor (FcγR) expression, leading to decreased uptake of antibody-nanoparticle conjugates and impaired phagocytosis of opsonized cells.

However, the molecular basis for the regulation of TLR-mediated signaling remains poorly understood. Here, we report that valosin containing protein interacting protein 1 (VCPIP1), a deubiquitinating enzyme, acts as a critical positive regulator of TLR4 signaling. TLR4 activation induces the upregulation and nuclear-to-cytoplasmic translocation of VCPIP1. The cytoplasmic VCPIP1 interacts with interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 and 2 (IRAK1/2) and maintains IRAK1/2 protein levels by reducing their degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Instead of directly deubiquitinating IRAK1/2 through the enzymatic activity, VCPIP1 blocks the K48 ubiquitination of IRAK1/2 in a non-catalytic manner. Ablation of VCPIP1 significantly attenuates LPS-induced inflammatory gene expression in macrophages. Consistently, VCPIP1-deficient mice are less susceptible to sepsis. Thus, this work reveals an essential role of VCPIP1 in TLR4 signaling and suggests that VCPIP1 may become a potential therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases.",

We investigate how mutations and a deletion in the KP.3.1.1 spike protein (S) affect hACE2 binding and antibody escape. Mass spectrometry confirms a new glycan site at residue N30 that alters the glycoforms at neighboring N61. Cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures show that the N30 glycan and rearrangement of adjacent residues do not significantly change the overall spike structure, up-down ratio of receptor-binding domains (RBDs), or hACE2 binding. Furthermore, a KP.3.1.1 S with hACE2 structure further confirms an epistatic effect between F456L and Q493E on hACE2 binding. Our analysis shows that SARS-CoV-2 variants that emerged after late 2023 are now incorporating reversions to residues found in other sarbecoviruses, including the N30 glycan, Q493E, and others.

Interestingly, palatable food exposure increased the activity level of ArcGABA neurons, which do not express the leptin receptor (non-LepR neurons; nonresponsive to leptin). Chronic activation of ArcGABA non-LepR neurons led to massive obesity, which was associated with normal leptin-induced pSTAT3 signaling but phenotypic leptin resistance; i.e., high leptin levels failing to reduce obesity. In contrast, chronic inhibition of ArcGABA non-LepR neurons effectively prevented and reversed DIO, suggesting a potential anti-obesity treatment strategy.

    "abstract": "Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a typically sexually dimorphic disease, and males are more vulnerable to I/R injury than females are. However, the molecular basis of the sex-based differences remains poorly defined. Here, using multi-omics integrative analysis, we identified the denticleless E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (DTL)-homeobox protein prospero-related homeobox 1 (PROX1) signaling axis as a key determinant of the sexual dimorphism associated with hepatic I/R injury. High post-hepatectomy DTL levels were accompanied by deteriorated hepatectomy patient function and correlated with augmented hepatocellular death. DTL was markedly up-regulated in hepatocytes during hepatic I/R injury, and it ubiquitinated and degraded PROX1.

    "abstract": "α-ketoglutaric acid (AKG), a tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolite central to aerobic metabolism and longevity, retains unresolved anti-aging protein targets. Here, we demonstrate that reduced isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) expression during senescence lowers AKG production, accelerating the aging of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Exogenous AKG or IDH1 overexpression restores AKG levels, enabling 2-oxoglutarate and Fe(II)-dependent oxygenase domain-containing protein 1 (OGFOD1)-catalyzed hydroxylation of ribosomal protein S23 (RPS23) at proline 62. Mechanistically, AKG stabilizes the OGFOD1-RPS23 complex, enhancing translation accuracy to limit misfolded protein accumulation while sustaining synthesis rates, thereby balancing proteostasis. The natural flavonoid scutellarin (Scu), identified as an IDH1 agonist, elevates AKG to delay MSC senescence. In aged mice, Scu improves cognitive function, reduces osteoporosis and skin aging, and suppresses senescence-associated secretory phenotype.

However, the mechanisms behind this phenomenon are not well understood. Our single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis revealed dynamic changes in cell heterogeneity within the fetal interscapular BAT (iBAT) from obese dams, leading to compromised thermogenesis in their offspring. Obese dams displayed elevated levels of circulating fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), while their fetuses exhibited lower circulating FGF21 due to reduced trans-placental transfer. Maternal FGF21, significantly increased during late gestation, was the primary source of fetal FGF21, played a crucial role in regulating fetal brown adipogenesis, and likely prevented metabolic dysfunction in offspring. Additionally, the impaired iBAT development in utero due to maternal obesity could be mitigated by postnatal FGF21 supplementation.

While the mechanisms that restrict body fat in males are becoming clearer, less is known about how females achieve higher fat storage.

Dietary sugar stimulates a female-specific increase in Drosophila insulin-like peptide 3 (Dilp3), which acts together with greater peripheral insulin sensitivity to augment insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway (IIS) activity in adult females. Indeed, Dilp3 overexpression prevented the female-biased decrease in body fat after removal of dietary sugar.

We find that many rRNA residues that are currently viewed as bacterial-specific features of ribosomal drug-binding sites are in fact conserved only in a subset of bacteria. Conversely, species with divergent drug-binding sites are widespread in nature, arising from ancient rRNA polymorphisms at the direct ribosome-drug interface. Using a few bacterial species harboring divergent drug-binding sites, we identify their intrinsic resistance to corresponding ribosome-targeting antibiotics.

High-depth cell-free DNA (cfDNA) sequencing analysis holds promise in advancing our understanding of GDM pathogenesis and prediction. In 299 women with GDM and 299 matched healthy pregnant women, distinct cfDNA fragment characteristics associated with GDM are identified throughout pregnancy. Integrating cfDNA profiles with lipidomic and single-cell transcriptomic data elucidates functional changes linked to altered lipid metabolism processes in GDM. Transcription start site (TSS) scores in 50 feature genes are used as the cfDNA signature to distinguish GDM cases from controls effectively. Notably, differential coverage of the islet acinar marker gene PRSS1 emerges as a valuable biomarker for GDM. A specialized neural network model is developed, predicting GDM occurrence and validated across two independent cohorts. This research underscores the high-depth cfDNA early prediction and characterization of GDM, offering insights into its molecular underpinnings and potential clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Hyperuricemic nephropathy (HN) is a global metabolic disorder characterized by uric acid (UA) metabolism dysfunction, resulting in hyperuricemia (HUA) and tubulointerstitial fibrosis (TIF). Sodium-dependent glucose transporter 2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin, has shown potential in reducing serum UA levels in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), though its protective effects against HN remain uncertain. This study investigates the functional, pathological, and molecular changes in HN through histological, biochemical, and transcriptomic analyses in patients, HN mice, and UA-stimulated HK-2 cells. Findings indicate UA-induced tubular dysfunction and fibrotic activation, which dapagliflozin significantly mitigates. Transcriptomic analysis identifies estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα), a downregulated transcription factor in HN. ERRα knockin mice and ERRα-overexpressed HK-2 cells demonstrate UA resistance, while ERRα inhibition exacerbates UA effects. Dapagliflozin targets ERRα, activating the ERRα-organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1) axis to enhance UA excretion and reduce TIF.

By using whole-genome CRISPR screening and RNA sequencing, we characterize the vulnerabilities of both persister and D/T-resistant cellular models. Oxidative stress together with concomitant induction of antioxidant responses is boosted by D/T treatment. However, the nature of the oxidative damage, the choice of redox detoxification systems, and the resulting therapeutic vulnerabilities display stage-specific differences. Persister cells suffer from lipid peroxidation and are sensitive to ferroptosis upon GPX4 inhibition in vivo. Biomarkers of lipid peroxidation are detected in clinical samples following D/T treatment. Acquired alterations leading to mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) reactivation enhance cystine transport to boost GPX4-independent antioxidant responses.

This imprint persists after secondary exposures wherein >60% of ensuing hybrid immunity derives from the original IgG pool. Monoclonal constituents of the original IgG pool can increase breadth, affinity, and prevalence upon secondary exposures, as exemplified by the plasma antibody SC27. Following a breakthrough infection, vaccine-induced SC27 gained neutralization breadth and potency against SARS-CoV-2 variants and zoonotic viruses (half-maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50] ∼0.1–1.75 nM) and increased its binding affinity to the protective RBD class 1/4 epitope (dissociation constant [KD] < 5 pM).

    "abstract": "Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is a common analgesic, but its mechanism of action remains unknown. Despite causing around 500 deaths annually in the US, safer alternatives have not been developed. Because endocannabinoids may have a role in acetaminophen action, we examine interactions between the two. We report that acetaminophen inhibits the activity of diacylglycerol lipase α (DAGLα), but not DAGLβ, decreasing the production of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl glycerol. This gives rise to the counterintuitive hypothesis that decreasing endocannabinoid production by DAGLα inhibition may be antinociceptive in certain settings. Supporting this hypothesis, we find that diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL) inhibition by RHC80267 is antinociceptive in wild-type but not CB1 knockout mice in the hot-plate test. We propose (1) that activation of DAGLα may exacerbate some forms of nociception and (2) a mechanism for the antinociceptive actions of acetaminophen, whereby acetaminophen inhibits a DAGLα/CB1-based circuit that plays a permissive role in at least one form of nociception.",

WARM shows the best performance on the internal test (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] for screening = 0.915; AUC for referral = 0.911) and the external multi-center test (AUC for screening = 0.912; AUC for referral = 0.902).

PerioAI is a full-stack process comprising four key components: intra-oral scan (IOS) segmentation, cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) image segmentation, multimodal data fusion, and digital probing measurement. We evaluated PerioAI on multicenter cohorts comprising 2,507 patients. Outstanding IOS and CBCT segmentation performances ensure accuracy throughout the full-stack process. Moreover, digital probing achieves remarkable precision with only 0.040mm error.

However, intraoperative mapping of EF with electrocorticography is laborious, time-consuming, and highly vulnerable to the effects of anesthesia. Here, we demonstrated that activated microglia can be reliable biomarkers for EF localization. Leveraging a newly developed ratiometric Raman nanosensor, ultraHOCls, we successfully visualize proinflammatory microglia in live epileptic mice, allowing for precise EF delineation without the interference of anesthesia. Compared to electrocorticography-guided surgery, ultraHOCl-guided surgery results in a substantial 61% reduction in total seizure burden in epileptic mouse models. Notably, ultraHOCls sprayed on freshly excised human brain tissues can effectively discriminate epileptic regions from non-epileptic tissues with high sensitivity (94.89%) and specificity (93.3%).

    "abstract": "Proteogenomic analysis is applied to samples from the CALGB 40601 (Alliance) randomized neoadjuvant trial of trastuzumab, lapatinib, or the combination to identify biomarkers associated with pathological response status. Absence of ERBB2 gene amplification and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein overexpression by proteogenomics is associated with non-pathological compete response (pCR) (p < 0.05), highlighting potential false positives from standard diagnostics. Pathway analysis in proteogenomics-confirmed HER2+ samples identifies elevated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and WNT-β-catenin signaling in non-pCR cases before treatment. Twenty-four pCR-associated proteins reproduce in a second proteomic dataset, and four (GPRC5A, TPBG, SP140L, and NEU1) are significant in a third. A meta-analysis of ten diverse neoadjuvant anti-HER2 treatment regimens from four independent studies confirms that non-pCR cases express higher levels of mRNA for G protein-coupled receptor class C group 5 member A (GPRC5A, p = 0.0002) and trophoblast glycoprotein (TPBG, p = 0.00008).

To tackle drug resistance and toxicity, second-generation targeted anti-mitotic agents and combination strategies are being explored but have yet to demonstrate meaningful clinical benefits. A limitation is the lack of a platform to compare strategies in models that capture disease heterogeneity. To overcome this, we screen 83 patient-derived ex vivo ovarian cancer models that exhibit extensive intra- and inter-patient heterogeneity, testing four distinct approaches to enhance taxol sensitivity. Inhibitors of the HSET kinesin or the Mps1 spindle assembly checkpoint kinase show minimal impact on the taxol sensitivity landscape. By contrast, Bcl-xL inhibition exerts a global anti-proliferative effect. Inhibition of the MDR1 drug efflux pump restores taxol sensitivity in models characterized by ABCB1 overexpression.

This study addresses the urgent need to develop treatments for BRAFi+MEKi-resistant glioma using preclinical mouse models and patient-derived materials. BRAFi+MEKi reveals glioma plasticity by heightening cell state transitions along glial differentiation trajectories, giving rise to astrocyte- and immunomodulatory oligodendrocyte (OL)-like states. PD-L1 upregulation in OL-like cells links cell state transitions to immune evasion, possibly orchestrated by Galectin-3. BRAFi+MEKi induces interferon response signatures, tumor infiltration, and suppression of T cells. Combining BRAFi+MEKi with immune checkpoint inhibition enhances survival in a T cell-dependent manner, reinvigorates T cells, and outperforms individual or sequential therapies in mice. Elevated PD-L1 expression in BRAF-mutant versus BRAF-wild-type glioblastoma supports the rationale for PD-1 inhibition in patients.

Acetate supplementation could rescue syncytiotrophoblast fusion from glycolysis deficiency by replenishing acetyl-CoA and maintaining histone acetylation, thus rescuing the activation of syncytialization genes. Even brief glycolysis deficiency could permanently inhibit differentiation potential and promote inflammation, which could also be permanently rescued by brief acetate supplementation in vivo.

ERVH48-1 encodes a fragment of a viral envelope that is expressed during early embryonic development. Loss of ERVH48-1 led to impaired mesoderm and cardiomyocyte commitment and diverted cells to an ectoderm-like fate. Mechanistically, ERVH48-1 is localized to sub-cellular membrane compartments through a functional N-terminal signal peptide and binds to the WNT antagonist SFRP2 to promote its polyubiquitination and degradation, thus limiting SFRP2 secretion and blocking repression of WNT/β-catenin signaling.

    "abstract": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal fibrotic disease. Recent studies have highlighted the persistence of an intermediate state of alveolar stem cells in IPF lungs. In this study, we discovered a close correlation between the distribution pattern of intermediate alveolar stem cells and the progression of fibrotic changes. We showed that amphiregulin (AREG) expression is significantly elevated in intermediate alveolar stem cells of mouse fibrotic lungs and IPF patients. High levels of serum AREG correlate significantly with profound deteriorations in lung function in IPF patients. We demonstrated that AREG in alveolar stem cells is both required and sufficient for activating EGFR in fibroblasts, thereby driving lung fibrosis. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of AREG using a neutralizing antibody effectively blocked the initiation and progression of lung fibrosis in mice. Our study underscores the therapeutic potential of anti-AREG antibodies in attenuating IPF progression, offering a promising strategy for treating fibrotic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are key regulators of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) homeostasis. Our research identifies the transcription factor Nynrin as a crucial regulator of HSC maintenance by modulating mitochondrial function. Nynrin is highly expressed in HSCs under both steady-state and stress conditions. The knockout Nynrin diminishes HSC frequency, dormancy, and self-renewal, with increased mitochondrial dysfunction indicated by abnormal mPTP opening, mitochondrial swelling, and elevated ROS levels. These changes reduce HSC radiation tolerance and promote necrosis-like phenotypes. By contrast, Nynrin overexpression in HSCs diminishes irradiation (IR)-induced lethality. The deletion of Nynrin activates Ppif, leading to overexpression of cyclophilin D (CypD) and further mitochondrial dysfunction. Strategies such as Ppif haploinsufficiency or pharmacological inhibition of CypD significantly mitigate these effects, restoring HSC function in Nynrin-deficient mice.

By combining clonal analyses with single-cell transcriptomics, we unveil striking parallels between lung regeneration and tumorigenesis that implicate Il1r1 as a common activator of AT2 reprogramming.

We revealed a feedback mechanism whereby the NSC proliferative state is directly repressed by transient amplifying cells (TAPs), their rapidly dividing progeny. NSC processes wrap around TAPs and display hotspots of Ca2+ activity at their points of contact, mediated by ephrin (Efn) signaling. The modulation of Efn signaling or TAP ablation altered the Ca2+ signature of NSCs, leading to their activation.

Using a mouse model of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), we show that bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from autoimmune mice exhibit hallmark features of TI, including increased Mycobacterium avium killing and inflammatory cytokine production, which are mechanistically linked to increased glycolytic metabolism. We show that HSCs from autoimmune mice constitute a transplantable, long-term reservoir for macrophages that exhibit the functional properties of TI. However, these BMDMs exhibit reduced glycolytic activity and chromatin accessibility at metabolic genes while retaining elevated expression of TI-associated transcriptional regulators. Hence, HSC exposed to autoimmune inflammation can give rise to macrophages in which the functional and metabolic properties of TI are decoupled. Our data support a model in which TI is characterized by a spectrum of molecular and metabolic states driving augmented immune function.",

While chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell immunotherapies target AML cells, they often induce severe on-target/off-tumor toxicity by attacking normal cells expressing the same antigen. Here, we used base editors (BEs) and a prime editor (PE) to modify the epitope of CD123 on HSPCs, protecting healthy cells from CAR-T-induced cytotoxicity while maintaining their normal function. Although BE effectively edits epitopes, complex bystander products are a concern. To enhance precision, we optimized prime editing, increasing the editing efficiency from 5.9% to 78.9% in HSPCs. Epitope-modified cells were resistant to CAR-T lysis while retaining normal differentiation and function.

By using a fate-mapping strain, Cyp2e1-DreER, to elucidate liver regeneration after acute pericentral injury, we found that pericentral regeneration is primarily compensated by the expansion of remaining pericentral hepatocytes, and secondarily by expansion of periportal hepatocytes. Employing single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, immunostaining, and in vivo functional assays, we demonstrated that the upregulated expression of the mTOR/4E-BP1 axis and lactate dehydrogenase A in hepatocytes contributes to pericentral regeneration, while activation of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β1) signaling in the damaged area mediates fibrotic responses and inhibits hepatocyte proliferation. Inhibiting the pericentral accumulation of monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages through an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide-based strategy attenuates these cell-derived TGF-β1 signalings, thus improving pericentral regeneration.

Bioinformatic analysis of the HSC transcriptome, biochemical assays, and genetic inactivation of FAO all indicate that FAO-generated NADPH fuels cholesterol synthesis in HSCs.

We found that HSPCs harbor comparatively small amounts of free iron and show the activation of a conserved molecular response to limited iron—particularly during mitosis. To study the functional and molecular consequences of iron restriction, we developed models allowing for transient iron bioavailability limitation and combined single-molecule RNA quantification, metabolomics, and single-cell transcriptomic analyses with functional studies.

In 3D, CRISPRa-programmed embryo models (CPEMs) exhibit morphological and transcriptomic similarity to pre-gastrulation mouse embryos.

    "abstract": "Post-implantation, the pluripotent epiblast in a human embryo forms a central lumen, paving the way for gastrulation. Osmotic pressure gradients are considered the drivers of lumen expansion across development, but their role in human epiblasts is unknown. Here, we study lumenogenesis in a pluripotent-stem-cell-based epiblast model using engineered hydrogels. We find that leaky junctions prevent osmotic pressure gradients in early epiblasts and, instead, forces from apical actin polymerization drive lumen expansion. Once the lumen reaches a radius of ∼12 μm, tight junctions mature, and osmotic pressure gradients develop to drive further growth. Computational modeling indicates that apical actin polymerization into a stiff network mediates initial lumen expansion and predicts a transition to pressure-driven growth in larger epiblasts to avoid buckling. Human epiblasts show transcriptional signatures consistent with these mechanisms. Thus, actin polymerization drives lumen expansion in the human epiblast and may serve as a general mechanism of early lumenogenesis.",

Human FTD neurons survived less and elicited an increased microglial response after transplantation into the mouse forebrain, which we further characterized by single nucleus RNA sequencing of microdissected grafts.

The RNA exosome, targeting a wide range of RNA substrates, is often downregulated in cellular senescence. Utilizing an auxin-inducible system, we observed that RNA exosome depletion in embryonic stem cells significantly affects the transcriptome and proteome, causing pluripotency loss and pre-senescence onset. Mechanistically, exosome depletion triggers acute nuclear RNA aggregation, disrupting nuclear RNA-protein equilibrium. This disturbance limits nuclear protein availability and hinders polymerase initiation and engagement, reducing gene transcription. Concurrently, it promptly disrupts nucleolar transcription, ribosomal processes, and nuclear exporting, resulting in a translational shutdown. Prolonged exosome depletion induces nuclear structural changes resembling senescent cells, including aberrant chromatin compaction, chromocenter disassembly, and intensified heterochromatic foci. These effects suggest that the dynamic turnover of nuclear RNA orchestrates crosstalk between essential processes to optimize cellular function.

We found that polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1) controls splicing of DPF2, a subunit of BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF) chromatin remodeling complexes. Dpf2 exon 7 splicing is inhibited by PTBP1 to produce the DPF2-S isoform early in development. During neuronal differentiation, loss of PTBP1 allows exon 7 inclusion and DPF2-L expression. Different cellular phenotypes and gene expression programs were induced by these alternative DPF2 isoforms. We identified chromatin binding sites enriched for each DPF2 isoform, as well as sites bound by both. In ESC, DPF2-S preferential sites were bound by pluripotency factors. In neuronal progenitors, DPF2-S sites were bound by nuclear factor I (NFI), while DPF2-L sites were bound by CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF). DPF2-S sites exhibited enhancer modifications, while DPF2-L sites showed promoter modifications.

    "abstract": "N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most prevalent internal modification on mRNAs, plays important roles in the nervous system. Whether neurogenesis in the hypothalamus, a region critical for controlling appetite, is regulated by m6A signaling, especially in humans, remains unclear. Here, we showed that deletion of m6A writer Mettl14 in the mouse embryonic hypothalamus led to adult obesity, with impaired glucose-insulin homeostasis and increased energy intake. Mechanistically, deletion of Mettl14 leads to hypothalamic arcuate nucleus neurogenesis deficits with reduced generation of feeding-related neurons and dysregulation of neurogenesis-related m6A-tagged transcripts. Deletion of m6A writer Mettl3 or m6A reader Ythdc1 shared similar phenotypes. METTL14 or YTHDC1 knockdown also led to reduced generation of feeding-related neurons in human brain subregion-specific arcuate nucleus organoids.

Here, we demonstrate an instructive role of glycolytic activity in regulating signaling pathways involved in mesoderm and endoderm specification. Using a mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC)-based in vitro model for gastrulation, we found that glycolysis inhibition increases ectodermal cell fates at the expense of mesodermal and endodermal lineages. We demonstrate that this relationship is dose dependent, enabling metabolic control of germ layer proportions through exogenous glucose levels. We further show that glycolysis acts as an upstream regulator of Nodal and Wnt signaling and that its influence on cell fate specification can be decoupled from its effects on growth.

Machine learning and integration of time-resolved single-cell RNA sequencing with imaging-based phenotypic profiling identified early features predictive of phenotypic end states.

    "abstract": "Chronic stress adversely affects intestinal health, but the specific neural pathways linking the brain to intestinal tissue are not fully understood. Here, we show that chronic stress-induced activation of the central amygdala-dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (CeA-DMV) pathway accelerates premature aging and impairs the stemness of intestinal stem cells (ISCs). This pathway influences ISC function independently of the microbiota, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the immune response, and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Under chronic stress, DMV-mediated vagal activation prompts cholinergic enteric neurons to release acetylcholine (ACh), which engages ISCs via the M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (CHRM3). This interaction activates the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, triggering growth arrest and mitochondrial fragmentation, thereby accelerating an aging-like decline in ISCs. Together, our findings provide insights into an alternative neural mechanism that links stress to intestinal dysfunction.

The model reliably captured a wide range of dynamics in cortex, liver, and blood transcriptomes taken from mice and humans under various experimental conditions. Sleep-wake-driven factors outweighed circadian factors in driving gene expression in the cortex, whereas the opposite was observed in the liver and blood.

We show that cell state—as set by proliferation history—defines how cells interpret the levels of TFs. Controlling for proliferation history and titrating each TF, we find that conversion correlates with levels of the pioneer TF Ngn2. By isolating cells by both their proliferation history and Ngn2 levels, we demonstrate that levels of Ngn2 expression alone are insufficient to predict conversion rates. Rather, proliferation history and TF levels combine to drive direct conversion. Finally, increasing the proliferation rate of adult human fibroblasts generates morphologically mature induced human motor neurons at high rates.",

However, low rates of direct conversion and complex protocols limit scalability and, thus, the potential of cell-fate conversion for biomedical applications. Here, we optimize the conversion protocol by examining process parameters, including transcript design; delivery via adeno-associated virus (AAV), retrovirus, and lentivirus; cell seeding density; and the impact of media conditions. Thus, we report a compact, portable conversion process that boosts proliferation and increases direct conversion of mouse fibroblasts to induced motor neurons (iMNs) to achieve high conversion rates of above 1,000%, corresponding to more than ten motor neurons yielded per cell seeded, which we achieve through expansion. Our optimized, direct conversion process generates functional motor neurons at scales relevant for cell therapies (>107 cells) that graft with the mouse central nervous system.

Among these communities, membership was largely determined by the donor stool, whereas relative abundances were determined by the supplemental carbon source. The absolute abundance of most taxa was independent of the supplementing nutrient due to the ability of a few organisms to quickly exhaust their niche in the complex medium and then exploit and monopolize the supplemental carbon source. Relative abundances of dominant taxa could be predicted from the nutritional preferences and growth dynamics of species in isolation, and exceptions were consistent with strain-level variation in growth capabilities.

Here, we explored a murine gut colonization model leveraging natural inter-individual variations in gut microbiomes to elucidate the spatiotemporal dynamics of FMT. We identified a natural “super-donor” consortium that robustly engrafts into diverse recipients and resists reciprocal colonization. Temporal profiling of the gut microbiome showed an ordered succession of rapid engraftment by early colonizers within 72 h, followed by a slower emergence of late colonizers over 15–30 days. Moreover, engraftment was localized to distinct compartments of the gastrointestinal tract in a species-specific manner. Spatial metagenomic characterization suggested engraftment was mediated by simultaneous transfer of spatially co-localizing species from the super-donor consortia.

Whereas p53 oscillates regularly, Mdm2 from a single MDM2 allele exhibits random unresponsiveness to ∼9% of p53 pulses. Using allelic-specific imaging of MDM2 activity, we show that MDM2 alleles buffer each other to maintain p53 pulse amplitude. Removal of MDM2 allelic buffering cripples the robustness of p53 amplitude, thereby elevating p21 levels and cell-cycle arrest. In silico simulations support that allelic buffering enhances the robustness of biological oscillators and broadens their plausible biochemical space.

    "abstract": "Turing patterns are self-organizing systems that can form spots, stripes, or labyrinths. Proposed examples in tissue organization include zebrafish pigmentation, digit spacing, and many others. The theory of Turing patterns in biology has been debated because of their stringent fine-tuning requirements, where patterns only occur within a small subset of parameters. This has complicated the engineering of synthetic Turing gene circuits from first principles, although natural genetic Turing networks have been identified. Here, we engineered a synthetic genetic reaction-diffusion system where three nodes interact according to a non-classical Turing network with improved parametric robustness. The system reproducibly generated stationary, periodic, concentric stripe patterns in growing E. coli colonies. A partial differential equation model reproduced the patterns, with a Turing parameter regime obtained by fitting to experimental data. Our synthetic Turing system can contribute to nanotechnologies, such as patterned biomaterial deposition, and provide insights into developmental patterning programs.

To eliminate spurious correlations and identify critical immune interactions in a public multi-modal dataset (systems serology, cytokines, and cytometry) of vaccinated macaques, we applied Markov fields (MFs), a data-driven approach that explains vaccine efficacy and immune correlations via multivariate network paths, without requiring large numbers of samples (i.e., macaques) relative to multivariate features.

Here, we use a recently developed statistical framework, model-X knockoffs, to control the FDR while accounting for indirect effects, nonlinear dose-response, and user-provided covariates. We adjust the procedure to estimate the FDR correctly even when measured against incomplete gold standards.

    "abstract": "Fibrosis remains a major unmet medical need. Simplifying principles are needed to better understand fibrosis and to yield new therapeutic approaches. Fibrosis is driven by myofibroblasts that interact with macrophages. A mathematical cell-circuit model predicts two types of fibrosis: hot fibrosis driven by macrophages and myofibroblasts and cold fibrosis driven by myofibroblasts alone. Testing these concepts in cardiac fibrosis resulting from myocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure (HF), we revealed that acute MI leads to cold fibrosis whereas chronic injury (HF) leads to hot fibrosis. MI-driven cold fibrosis is conserved in pigs and humans. We computationally identified a vulnerability of cold fibrosis: the myofibroblast autocrine growth factor loop. Inhibiting this loop by targeting TIMP1 with neutralizing antibodies reduced myofibroblast proliferation and fibrosis post-MI in mice. Our study demonstrates the utility of the concepts of hot and cold fibrosis and the feasibility of a circuit-to-target approach to pinpoint a treatment strategy that reduces fibrosis.

We propose that adaptive therapy, which dynamically reduces treatment based on the tumor dynamics, might alleviate both issues. Utilizing in vitro time-lapse microscopy and stepwise model selection, we calibrate and validate a differential equation mathematical model, which we leverage to test different plausible adaptive treatment schedules. Our model indicates that adjusting the dosage, rather than skipping treatments, is more effective at reducing drug use while maintaining efficacy due to a delay in cell kill and a diminishing dose-response relationship. In vivo pilot experiments confirm this conclusion. Although our focus is toxicity mitigation, reducing drug use may also delay resistance.

Interestingly, an optimal tail length of ∼100 nt displays the highest translation rate, which is identical to the average endogenous tail length measured by nanopore sequencing. Furthermore, poly(A)-tail length variability—a feature of endogenous mRNAs—impacts translation efficiency but not mRNA degradation rates.

For protein kinases, substrates may have full or only partial matches to the kinase recognition motif, a property known as “substrate quality.” However, it is not clear whether differences in substrate quality represent neutral variation or if they have functional consequences. We examine this question for the kinase CK2, which has many fundamental functions. We show that optimal CK2 sites are phosphorylated at maximal stoichiometries and found in many conditions, whereas minimal substrates are more weakly phosphorylated and have regulatory functions. Optimal CK2 sites tend to be more conserved, and substrate quality is often tuned by selection. For intermediate sites, increases or decreases in substrate quality may be deleterious, as we demonstrate for a CK2 substrate at the kinetochore. The results together suggest a strong role for substrate quality in phosphosite function and evolution.

    "title": "Impossible ecologies: Interaction networks and stability of coexistence in ecological communities",
    "abstract": "Does an ecological community allow stable species coexistence? Identifying the general effects of competitive, mutualistic, and predator-prey interactions on stability remains a central problem of systems ecology because established approaches cannot account for the full network arrangement of these interactions. Here, we therefore analyze all interaction networks of N≤5 species with Lotka-Volterra dynamics by combining exact results and numerical exploration. We find that a very small subset of these networks is “impossible ecologies,” in which stable coexistence is non-trivially impossible. We prove that the possibility of stable coexistence is determined by similarly rare “irreducible ecologies.” Statistical sampling shows that this probability varies over orders of magnitude even in ecologies that differ only in the network arrangement of identical interactions. Thus, our approach reveals that the full network structure of interactions can influence stability of coexistence more than the established effect of interaction-type proportions.",

An emerging consensus is to instead use modified human protein domains, but these domains include nonhuman peptides around mutated residues and at interdomain junctions, which may also be immunogenic. We present a modular workflow to optimize protein function and minimize immunogenicity by using existing machine learning models that predict protein function and peptide-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) presentation. We first applied this workflow to existing transcriptional activation and RNA-binding domains by removing potentially immunogenic MHC II epitopes. We then generated small-molecule-controllable transcription factors with human-derived DNA-binding domains targeting non-genomic DNA sequences. Finally, we established a workflow for creating deimmunized zinc-finger arrays to target arbitrary DNA sequences and upregulated two therapeutically relevant genes, utrophin (UTRN) and sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 1 (SCN1A), using it.

We generated a 3D timelapse dataset of thousands of nuclei over multiple days and developed open-source tools for image and data analysis and feature-based timelapse data exploration. Together, these data, tools, and workflows comprise a framework for systematic quantitative analysis of dynamics at individual and population levels, and the analysis further highlights important aspects to consider when interpreting timelapse data. We found that individual nuclear volume growth trajectories arise from short-timescale variations attributable to their spatiotemporal context within the colony. We identified a time-invariant volume compensation relationship between nuclear growth duration and starting volume across the population. Notably, we discovered that inheritance plays a crucial role in determining these two key nuclear growth features while other growth features are determined by their spatiotemporal context and are not inherited.",

We investigate the role of the arc operon in probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 on human gut community assembly and health-relevant metabolite profiles.

We use a tailored machine learning model for microbiomes to predict community assembly in response to variation in initial media pH and arc operon activity. This model uncovers the pH- and arc operon-dependent interactions shaping community assembly. Human gut species display altered colonization dynamics in response to the arc operon in the murine gut.

Here, we use single-cell sequencing to map diverse signaling inputs to transcriptional outputs, focusing on a defined library of clinically relevant ICD architectures. Informed by these observations, we functionally characterize transcriptionally distinct ICD variants across various contexts to build comprehensive maps from ICD composition to phenotypic output.

This systematic literature review examines collaborative innovation within this process, analyzing current practices and identifying future research directions. The review used an evidence-based approach, retrieving 737 papers through a Web of Science “All Databases” search, and ultimately selecting 74 articles for discussion. The articles were categorized according to the initiation, implementation, and closure phases of collaborative innovation, and were classified into homogeneous and heterogeneous collaborations. Using this framework, we systematically reviewed the existing knowledge, with a particular focus on how collaborative innovation can be successfully initiated and implemented, and how it can generate positive outcomes for drug research.",

    "abstract": "Activating mutations in the catalytic kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are crucial drivers of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our understanding of the structural changes induced by such mutations has evolved alongside the rational design of targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), leading to improved anti-tumor responses through appropriate patient stratification. However, challenges remain, including a growing number of therapy adaptation mechanisms and acquired resistance, which are further complicated by the intricate signaling networks of EGFR. Here, we review the rational development and targeting of EGFR-TKIs in the context of TKI-induced cellular death, adaptation, resistance, and eventual clinical failure, to provide a birds-eye view of this highly multidisciplinary field. We end by proposing new approaches based on our developing understanding of the quaternary structure of EGFR, which leverage in situ oligomer architectures to develop therapies that modulate EGFR oligomer-specific interactions and exploit weaknesses in its downstream signaling network to overcome resistance.",

    "abstract": "Posterior fossa syndrome (PFS) is a serious postoperative complication that primarily affects children following resection of posterior fossa tumors. Although its complex pathophysiology, involving disruption of cerebellar structures and the dentato–thalamo-cortical pathway, is increasingly being elucidated, effective treatments remain limited. This perspective explores acetyl-DL-leucine (ADLL) and its active L-enantiomer, N-acetyl-L-leucine (NALL), as promising therapeutic candidates for PFS. Emerging mechanistic, preclinical, and clinical evidence suggests that both compounds might alleviate PFS symptoms through neuroprotective and neurorestorative mechanisms, including neuronal membrane stabilization, metabolic enhancement, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, and dopaminergic modulation. NALL, which has greater neurotherapeutic potential than ADLL, might particularly support recovery through its multimodal effects on neuronal function, thereby enhancing perioperative resilience. Further translational research into these acetylated leucine analogues is warranted.",

In recent years, it has been discovered that its expression is upregulated in numerous tumors and is correlated with the onset and progression of tumors, as well as poor prognosis. In contrast to its isoenzymes, it is overexpressed in tumors and is either expressed at low levels or not expressed at all in normal tissues. Consequently, it has received extensive attention and has been proposed as a novel anticancer target. In this paper, we review the functions of MTHFD2 in tumors, its regulatory mechanisms, and research progress on MTHFD2 inhibitors.

Innate immunity rapidly detects pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), whereas adaptive immunity mediates antigen-specific T/B cell responses. The NLRP3 inflammasome, a key cytoplasmic PRR, consists of leucine-rich repeat, nucleotide-binding, and pyrin domains. Its activation requires priming (signal 1: Toll-like receptors/NOD-like receptors/cytokine receptors) and activation (signal 2: PAMPs/DAMPs/particulates). NLRP3 triggers cytokine storms and neuroinflammation, contributing to inflammatory diseases. Emerging therapies target NLRP3 via nuclear receptors (transcriptional regulation), adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors (gene delivery), and microRNAs (post-transcriptional modulation).

Here, to facilitate applications of this approach, we present the DropFit web server (https://www-cohsoftware.ch.cam.ac.uk/index.php/dropfit). DropFit can be used to estimate the critical concentration using experimental data on the length, area, or volume of the precritical droplets, which are taken away from the critical concentration and thus be more accurate and reproducible.

    "abstract": "Tools for genotyping copy number in whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data exist. Despite their availability, there are a limited number of tools that efficiently process this data at scale with rapid compute time, low memory usage, and easy to parse outputs. This is critical as WGS continues to be housed in the “cloud.” Copy Number Private Investigator (CNPI) is a computational toolkit (https://github.com/TNTurnerLab/CNPI) that performs several tasks including genotyping of regions of interest, digital karyotype determination, assessment of chromosomal sex, plotting of copy number in regions of the genome, and generation of an Individual-level Copy Number Score (ICNS). Inputs to CNPI include copy number estimates, genome-wide, from WGS data and a corresponding reference annotation file. With these inputs, CNPI can genotype any regions of the genome rapidly. For example, all genes in the genome can be genotyped in <2 s with 1 CPU and <1 GB memory. Benchmarking against gold-standard NA12878 data demonstrated good results with flexibility for users to optimize copy number thresholds based on desired sensitivity and specificity. Usage of CNPI is customizable with a variety of user-tailored functions and arguments. CNPI can be deployed to cloud based environments such as AWS lambda due to its intuitive design, near-zero cost per sample, and availability of compute resources. The application of ICNS has proven to be useful by comparing unaffected individuals to individuals with autism and 9p deletion syndrome, respectively. Overall, CNPI is advantageous for its ability to quickly provide reliable and precise copy number assessments of human genomic data.",

    "abstract": "Trm56 from Thermoplasma acidophilum is an exceptional SpoU-TrmD superfamily enzyme, which possesses an unusually long C-terminal region, and catalyzes methylation of 2′-OH of ribose of C56 in tRNA. T. acidophilum Trm56 methylates elongator tRNAMet (tRNAMete) transcript effectively, however this enzyme methylates tRNALeu transcript slowly. This enzymatic feature is common in T. acidophilum Trm56 and Pyrococcus horikoshii Trm56, which possesses a short C-terminal region. Kinetic analysis revealed that Km value of T. acidophilum Trm56 for tRNALeu is larger than that for tRNAMete. Our analysis of native tRNAs revealed that the 2′-O-methylcytidine content at position 56 (Cm56) in tRNALeu is 1.9% while in tRNAMete it is 63.1%, showing that the in vitro enzymatic properties of T. acidophilum Trm56 are reflected in the Cm56 modification levels in living cells. Experiments with chimera tRNA transcript of tRNALeu and tRNAMete showed that T. acidophilum Trm56 recognizes the T-loop and the three-dimensional core of tRNA. Furthermore, experiments with mutant tRNAMete transcript revealed that the G53-C61 base pair and U54U55C56purine57purine58 sequence are essential for methylation. Crystal structures of apo- and 5′-methyl-5′-thioadenosine binding forms of the catalytic domain of T. acidophilum Trm56 revealed that the structure of the 5′-methyl-5′-thioadenosine binding pocket and overall structure of the catalytic domain of T. acidophilum Trm56 closely resemble those of P. horikoshii Trm56. Experiments with a chimera of T. acidophilum and P. horikoshii Trm56 proteins demonstrates that the catalytic domain of T. acidophilum Trm56 is responsible for the slow methylation of tRNALeu transcript.",

    "abstract": "The combination of lysozyme with antibiotics has emerged as a promising strategy to combat bacterial resistance; however, the lack of mechanistic understanding regarding their molecular-level interactions remains a critical knowledge gap, hindering the rational design of optimized synergistic therapies. Through integrated spectroscopic techniques (FTIR, CD, UV–vis, fluorescence), thermodynamic analyses, molecular docking, and 200-ns molecular dynamics simulation, we established that doxycycline/tigecycline bind lysozyme via moderate-affinity hydrophobic interactions (Ka ∼ 104 L mol−1) but with distinct binding patterns-tigecycline forms additional hydrogen bonds through its glycylamino side chain, yielding higher stability and lower free drug fraction (fu) compare to doxycycline. Additionally, doxycycline and tigecycline have a relatively mild effect on lysozyme conformation, but doxycycline has a greater impact on lysozyme conformation than tigecycline. Key findings reveal a paradoxical efficacy relationship: while doxycycline exhibits stronger intrinsic antibacterial activity, the lysozyme-tigecycline complex demonstrates synergistic enhancement (particularly against E. coli) through stable binding-mediated protection and optimized release kinetics, whereas lysozyme-doxycycline’s weaker binding leads to premature release and reduced activity. These results fundamentally advance protein-drug interaction paradigms by demonstrating that optimal therapeutic outcomes require balanced binding stability, with broader implications for designing lysozyme-based delivery systems where moderately strong interactions enable synergistic effects while preserving structural integrity, offering a template for developing combination therapies against antimicrobial resistance.",

    "abstract": "Lysine demethylase 5A (KDM5A) plays a key role in the regulation of chromatin accessibility by catalyzing the removal of trimethyl marks on histone H3K4 (H3K4me3). KDM5A is also an oncogenic driver, with overexpression of KDM5A observed in various cancers, including breast, lung, and ovarian cancer. Past studies have characterized the functions of KDM5A domains, including KDM5A interactions with the histone H3 tail, but have yet to identify the broader mechanisms that drive KDM5A binding to the nucleosome. Through investigation of binding and catalysis on nucleosome substrates, we uncovered multivalent interactions of KDM5A with the H2A/H2B acidic patch and DNA that play crucial roles in the regulation of catalytic activity. We also identified an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) containing bifunctional arginine-rich motifs capable of binding to both the histone H2A/H2B acidic patch and nucleosomal DNA that is necessary for catalysis on nucleosome substrates. Our findings both elucidate previously unknown mechanisms that regulate KDM5A catalytic activity and reveal the ability of an IDR to engage in multiple interactions with chromatin.",

    "title": "SeqWord Motif Mapper: A Tool for Rapid Statistical Analysis and Visualization of Epigenetic Modifications in Bacterial Genomes",
    "abstract": "Genomic methylation in bacteria plays a crucial role in gene regulation, chromosome replication, pathogenicity, and defense against phages. While single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing technologies have advanced the detection of epigenetically modified bases, the statistical analysis of their distribution and the possible roles they play in bacterial cells remains challenging. To address this gap, we developed SeqWord Motif Mapper (SWMM), a computational tool designed for the statistical analysis and visualization of bacterial methylation patterns. SWMM utilizes PacBio sequencing data to identify sequence coverage, methylation motif distribution, and putative functional associations. Implemented in Python 3.9, the tool is platform-independent and requires minimal dependencies, making it accessible to a wide range of users. The SWMM command-line interface and a web-based version of the program facilitate the exploration of epigenetic modifications across bacterial genomes. Through case studies on different bacterial and archaeal taxa, we demonstrated that genome methylation in microorganisms extends beyond canonical sites and possibly influences gene expression, adaptation, and genome architecture. The tool enables detailed statistical evaluation of methylation motif distribution and provides insights into the potential regulatory roles of epigenetic modifications in bacterial genomes. SWMM is freely available at https://begp.bi.up.ac.za, with source code hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/chrilef/BactEpiGenPro.",

    "title": "Human Plastins are Novel Cytoskeletal pH Sensors with a Reduced F-actin Bundling Capacity at Basic pH",
    "abstract": "Intracellular pH (pHi) is a fundamental component of cell homeostasis. Controlled elevations in pHi precede and accompany cell polarization, cytokinesis, and directional migration. pH dysregulation contributes to cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, and other metabolic disorders. While cytoskeletal rearrangements are crucial for these processes, only a few cytoskeletal proteins, namely CDC42, cofilin, talin, cortactin, α-actinin, and AIP1 have been documented as pH sensors. Here, we report that actin-bundling proteins plastin 2 (PLS2, aka LCP1) and plastin 3 (PLS3) respond to physiological scale pH fluctuations by a reduced F-actin bundling at alkaline pH. The inhibition of PLS2 actin-bundling activity at elevated pH stems from the reduced affinity of the N-terminal actin-binding domain (ABD1) to actin. In fibroblast cells, elevated cytosolic pH caused the dissociation of ectopically expressed PLS2 and 3 from actin structures, whereas acidic conditions promoted their tighter association with focal adhesions and stress fibers. We identified His207 as one of the pH-sensing residues of PLS2 whose mutation to Lys and Tyr reduces pH sensitivity by enhancing and inhibiting the bundling ability, respectively. Our results suggest that weaker actin bundling by plastin isoforms at alkaline pH favors higher dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton. Therefore, like other cytoskeleton pH sensors, plastins promote disassembly and faster dynamics of cytoskeletal components during cytokinesis and cell migration. Since both plastins are implemented in cancer, their pH sensitivity may contribute to the accelerated proliferation and enhanced invasive and metastatic potentials of cancer cells at alkaline pHi.",

    "abstract": "Legionella pneumophila is a pathogenic Gram-negative bacterium that causes Legionnaires’ disease. The main virulence factor of L. pneumophila is the Dot/Icm Type IV Secretion System (T4SS), which translocates effector proteins into the cytoplasm of the host cell, allowing the bacterium to establish a replicative niche. The outer membrane core complex (OMCC), the T4SS machinery localized between the inner and outer membranes, is composed of at least nine proteins organized into various sub-complexes that include the dome, outer membrane cap (OMC), periplasmic ring (PR), and stalk. In this study we describe how two uncharacterized Dot/Icm T4SS components, Dis2 and Dis3, contribute to the structure of the T4SS, the ability of the T4SS to translocate effectors, and the pathogenicity of L. pneumophila. Using cryo-electron microscopy we show that OMCCs purified from a Δdis2 strain are only missing the density for Dis2, while OMCCs purified from the Δdis3 strain lack densities for Dis3 and DotF in the OMC. Despite missing these proteins, the OMC and PR of both mutant OMCCs remain structurally stable. Strains lacking dis2 and or dis3 efficiently replicate in human macrophages; however, they have subtle differences in translocation efficiency for four tested substrates. Combined these data indicate that Dis2 or Dis3 are not required for the stability or global organization of the OMCC, but each protein may contribute to the efficient translocation of specific effectors.",

    "abstract": "TDP-43 proteinopathies, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), are characterized by aberrant cytoplasmic mislocalization and aggregation of TDP-43. Here, we established a live-cell TDP43-BiFC model to visualize TDP-43 oligomerization in real time and screened diverse cellular stressors. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition emerged as the most potent trigger of TDP-43 oligomerization. In particular, selective inhibition of the shuttling HDAC4/5 with LMK-235 induced an early and robust formation of cytoplasmic TDP-43 oligomers, comparable to or even exceeding the effect of the pan-HDAC inhibitor apicidin. In contrast, nuclear-restricted HDAC1/3 inhibition by MS-275 prolonged TDP-43 retention in the nucleus with minimal cytoplasmic mislocalization or oligomerization, underscoring distinct roles for nuclear versus nucleocytoplasmic HDACs. Inhibition of cytoplasmic HDAC6 (tubastatin A) had no significant effect. Notably, both shuttling and pan-HDAC inhibition increased TDP-43 acetylation and promoted the accumulation of stable, disulfide-linked TDP-43 oligomers. These findings identify lysine acetylation as a key regulator of disulfide bond-dependent TDP-43 oligomerization and suggest that targeting nucleocytoplasmic HDACs could be a novel therapeutic strategy in TDP-43 proteinopathies.",

    "title": "Condensate Formation of the Human RNA-binding Protein SMAUG1 is Controlled by its Intrinsically Disordered Regions and Interactions with 14-3-3 Proteins",
    "abstract": "SMAUG1 is a human RNA-binding protein (RBP) that is dysregulated in a wide range of diseases. It is evolutionarily conserved and forms condensates containing translationally repressed RNAs. This indicates that condensation is central to SMAUG1 function. In this work, we show that a prion-like disordered region within the C-terminal half of SMAUG1 is required, but not sufficient, to drive formation of liquid-like condensates in cells. We use biochemical assays to show that SMAUG1 liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) appears to be independent of RNA binding and does not depend on other large, disordered regions of the protein that potentially harbor several binding sites for partner proteins. Using a combination of computational predictions, structural modeling, in vitro and in cell measurements, we show that SMAUG1-driven condensation is negatively regulated by direct interactions with members of the 14-3-3 protein family. These interactions are mediated by at least four distinct phospho-regulated short linear motifs within the disordered regions of SMAUG1, working synergistically. Interactions between SMAUG1 and dimeric 14-3-3 proteins drive the dissolution of condensates and are likely intertwined with other unknown regulatory mechanisms. Interestingly, a monomeric 14-3-3 variant cannot induce condensate dissolution, suggesting that the conformational constraints imposed on the SMAUG1 polypeptide chain by dimeric 14-3-3 proteins, potentially bridging distant binding sites, are important for the described phase separation-regulatory mechanism. Our results reinforce recent findings on the general regulatory role of 14-3-3 proteins in biological condensation and provide valuable novel insights into how SMAUG1 phase separation is regulated.",

Despite the discovery of effective vaccines and therapeutic interventions, coronaviruses remain a threat to humans as the emergence of novel variants or new pathogenic coronaviruses is possible. The N protein or nucleocapsid protein, belonging to the virus’ essential proteins, is mainly involved in the compaction and protection of the viral genome. Here, we show that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein is a very efficient chaperone protein of nucleic acids that aggregates nucleic acids and anneals well-folded and complementary oligonucleotides hairpins in vitro. Using fluorescence and gel shift electrophoresis methods, we showed the high ability of the protein to destabilize nucleic acid secondary structure and to anneal nucleic acid strands. This last activity needs the full-length protein as we demonstrate that protein fragments, while they could display some activities, are considerably less efficient. However, the ability of the full-length protein to destabilize small double-stranded RNAs is poor. Our results show that the N protein possesses a chaperone activity similar to the HIV-1 NCp7 and NCp9 nucleocapsid proteins known as powerful nucleic acid chaperons.",

    "abstract": "Non-covalent lasso entanglements are structural motifs found in a majority of globular proteins, and their misfolding has been linked to a range of biological consequences. Here, we characterize these motifs’ structural and physicochemical properties, sequence biases, functional site correlations, and universal features across E. coli, S. cerevisiae, and H. sapiens. We find that the crossing residues, which pierce the plane of the entanglement loop, are 11-times more likely to be a β-strand than an α-helix or random coil, and that around this position the protein sequence is 2.5-times more likely to be composed of a stretch of all hydrophobic residues (most often Val, Ile, or Phe) compared to other sequence motifs. Functionally, crossing residues are enriched at enzyme active sites in S. cerevisiae and small molecule binding residues across all species to degrees greater than expected by random chance. Metal binding residues are enriched in these entanglements in H. sapiens. Increasing statistical power by pooling together these species data, we find RNA-binding residues are enriched in these entanglement components. On the other hand, there is a spatial depletion of crossing residues at sites involved in protein binding. Using machine learning, we identified eight robust features predictive of these entanglements, achieving AUROC scores of 0.8 across species. These results are significant because they suggest a direct role for components of native entanglements in particular protein functions, as well as identifying strong secondary structure and sequence preferences in native entanglements.",

    "abstract": "The outer membrane (OM) of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) containing-diderm bacteria is crowded with outer membrane proteins (OMPs) that reside in a membrane that is relatively rich in protein and poor in lipid. As a consequence, extensive interactions between OMPs occur. Yet, how these interactions affect OMP function remains unexplored. Here, we examine the effect of OmpA on the activity of three different OMP enzymes, OmpLA (a phospholipase), PagP (a palmitoyltransferase) and OmpT (a protease). We show that OmpA-OmpT interactions enhance the activity of OmpT, and that this catalytic enhancement is mediated via their extracellular loops, an effect that is not observed with other common OMPs, including OmpF and OmpX. In contrast, OmpA specifically reduces the activity of PagP, while OmpLA activity shows no significant change. Possible interactions between the abundant E. coli OMPs (OmpA, OmpF/C, OmpT, OmpX, MipA) and all other E. coli OMPs were screened via Alphafold predictions, with the results suggesting that smaller OMPs are generally more promiscuous interactors, and identifying new interactions that may plausibly form in the OMP-rich islands in the OM. Together, the results identify a previously underappreciated role for specific OMP–OMP interactions in modulating protein function in the OM, and highlight how evolution may have exploited the high local concentrations of abundant OMPs in the OM to tune enzyme activity.",

A truncated variant of Ataxin-3 with two ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) has recently been shown to undergo liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying Ataxin-3 aggregation through amyloid formation and phase separation remain unclear. Here we investigated the LLPS properties of Ataxin-3 with three UIMs, the most abundant isoform found in the brain. Ataxin-3 Q25 forms phase-separated droplets which undergo aging, producing amyloid-like fibrillar structures. PolyQ expanded Q54 forms short-lived droplets that exhibit rapid maturation. Ataxin-3 C-terminal fragment forms unique straight, unbranched amyloid fibrils which display negligible Thioflavin-T binding. Rad23B, the main constituent driving the formation of proteasomal condensates, is a known Ataxin-3 interactor. We found that heterotypic interactions with Rad23B inhibit Ataxin-3 droplet maturation but do not inhibit amyloid formation under dilute conditions, suggesting that Ataxin-3 aggregation via misfolding pathway is distinct from condensation pathway. Finally, we show that Ataxin-3 is incorporated into liquid-like stress granules under arsenite stress, shedding light on its roles in aggregation dynamics and stress responses.",

Despite their functional significance and therapeutic potential, lncRNAs’ mechanisms of action remain understudied. One such lncRNA is the Second Chromosome Locus Associated with Prostate-1 (SChLAP1). SChLAP1 is overexpressed in malignant prostate cancer and is associated with unfavorable patient outcomes, such as metastasis and increased mortality. In this study, we demonstrated that SChLAP1 possesses distinct structural domains and conserved regions that may contribute to its function. We determined the secondary structure of SChLAP1 using chemical probing methods combined with mutational profiling (DMS-MaP and SHAPE-MaP). Our in vitro secondary structural model revealed that SChLAP1 consists of two distinct secondary structural modules located at its 5′ and 3′ ends, both featuring regions with a high degree of structural organization. Our in vivo chemical probing identified structurally stable regions and areas that may undergo specific structural rearrangements in the cellular context. Overexpression of the modules led to a notable increase in cancer cell proliferation and invasion, proving their functional significance in the oncogenicity of SChLAP1. In conclusion, we discovered functionally important, independent modules with well-defined structures of SChLAP1. These results will serve as a guide to explore the detailed molecular mechanisms by which SChLAP1 promotes aggressive prostate cancer, ultimately contributing to the development of SChLAP1 as a novel therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play pivotal roles in cellular regulation, and their dysregulation is closely linked to a wide spectrum of human diseases; thus, accurate miRNA–disease association prediction is critical for guiding experimental validation and therapeutic development. In this work, we propose RGFMDA, an innovative framework designed to predict miRNA-disease associations more effectively. RGFMDA employs a residual graph sampling and aggregation network to enhance information localization within miRNA and disease networks. It also features a nonlinear integration of features and a global context integration module that synergistically combine feature interactions and oversee global dependencies. Additionally, the framework uses triplet contrastive learning to refine the distinction between associated and non-associated miRNA-disease pairs, enhancing the accuracy of predictions. On the HMDD v2.0 benchmark, RGFMDA achieved an AUC of 0.9524, surpassing existing approaches whose reported AUC values range from approximately 0.916 to 0.942. On the HMDD v3.2 dataset, RGFMDA further improved performance with an AUC of 0.9604, exceeding state-of-the-art models that demonstrate AUCs between roughly 0.912 and 0.953. Case studies involving lung, esophageal, breast, and colorectal cancers have further confirmed the efficacy of RGFMDA. In summary, RGFMDA represents a robust and reliable computational tool for uncovering novel miRNA–disease associations, thereby facilitating future biological discovery and therapeutic development.",

    "title": "Structural and Functional Characterization of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Virulence Factor AaaA, an Autotransporter with Arginine-Specific Aminopeptidase Activity",
    "abstract": "AaaA is a virulence-associated outer membrane protein found in the Gram-negative pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Classified as both an autotransporter and a member of the M28 family of aminopeptidases, AaaA has been shown to cleave N-terminal arginine residues from host-derived peptides. This activity has been demonstrated to enhance bacterial survival and suppress host immune responses by increasing local arginine availability. Here, we report the first successful purification and combined structural and biochemical characterization of full-length AaaA. We resolved its cryo-EM structure at 3.87 Å resolution, revealing the canonical three-domain architecture of autotransporters: a signal peptide, a passenger domain, and a translocator domain. Notably, the passenger domain adopts a compact globular fold characteristic of M28 aminopeptidases, which is less common than the extended or β-helical structures observed in the majority of autotransporters structurally characterized to date. The structure reveals a zinc-coordinated catalytic site and a negatively charged substrate binding pocket, consistent with specificity for positively charged N-terminal arginine residues. Mutagenesis of active site residues confirmed the molecular basis for arginine recognition. Functional assays demonstrated that AaaA exhibits zinc-dependent aminopeptidase activity across a broad pH (6–10) and temperature (20–60 °C) range. Together, these findings provide fundamental insights into the structure and function of AaaA and establish a framework for future efforts to develop targeted inhibitors that may attenuate P. aeruginosa virulence.",

    "abstract": "Unlike AI-based protein structure prediction, the sequence determinants of protein dynamics, and thus function, remain elusive. The nucleotide switch in Arf GTPases involves a massive structural change, which we showed recently in Arf1 is facilitated by a dynamic molten globule ensemble. Here we investigate the unresolved sequence-dynamics paradigm by comparing Arf1 and Arf6 using a combination of high-pressure NMR and other biophysical methods. We show that, as for Arf1, the Arf6 nucleotide switch implicates a functional molten globule ensemble, suggesting that this mechanism is a general feature of Arf and Arf-like GTPases. Comparison of the local stability distributions identifies key sequence determinants for the differences in switching between Arf1 and Arf6. Remarkably, these determinants are distant from the nucleotide-binding site, revealing back-to-front allosteric coupling controlling the switch. Evolutionary covariance analysis suggests that this back-to-front allosteric coupling is a fundamental characteristic of the Arf and Arf-like family, and may extend to the entire small GTPase kingdom. Our study thus establishes notable sequence-dynamics relationships with implications for signaling and diseases.",

However, the specific mitophagy pathways involved and their temporal dynamics during retinal development and maturation remain poorly understood. Using proteomics analysis of isolated mouse retinas across developmental stages and the mitophagy reporter mouse line, mito-QC, we characterized mitophagy throughout retinogenesis. While mitolysosomes were more prevalent in the mature retina, we observed two distinct mitophagy peaks during embryonic development. The first, independent of PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) activation, was associated with RGCs. The second, PINK1-dependent peak was triggered after an increase in retinal oxidative stress. This PINK1-dependent, oxidative stress-induced mitophagy pathway is conserved in mice and zebrafish, providing the first evidence of programmed, PINK1-dependent mitophagy during development.",

    "abstract": "Mass spectrometry (MS) has emerged as a powerful omics analysis technique, particularly in proteomics, where the initial step involves identifying MS spectra as peptide sequences. However, this process often requires substantial computational resources and expertise, taking hours or even days to complete, thereby limiting the widespread adoption of MS-based omics technologies. To overcome this challenge, we have developed DeepMS, a deep learning-based spectra identification algorithm that overcomes the speed limitations of traditional spectra identification methods. We conducted comprehensive benchmark tests, comparing six deep learning algorithms. Based on the results, we selected the VGG16 algorithm as the core model for DeepMS. This algorithm enables super-fast, end-to-end identification of peptide sequences from MS spectra with high accuracy. DeepMS is adaptable to post-translational modifications, enhancing its versatility. In fact, its identification speed surpasses the generation rate of MS spectra, enabling super-fast identification. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical application of DeepMS in microorganism detection, highlighting its utility in clinical testing. Through the implementation of DeepMS, our aim is to revolutionize the field of MS-based proteomics and facilitate the broader application of omics technologies, opening new avenues for rapid and efficient analysis in various research and clinical domains.",

    "title": "pLMMoRF: A Web Server That Accurately Predicts Membrane-interacting Molecular Recognition Features by Employing a Protein Language Model",
    "abstract": "Interactions between proteins and lipids are crucial for numerous cellular processes. Some of the lipid interacting segments in protein sequences are intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), which may gain secondary structures upon binding. We collected experimentally annotated lipid-interacting IDRs, named membrane molecular recognition features (MemMoRFs). We used this dataset to develop and test an accurate and relatively fast sequence-based MemMoRF predictor, pLMMoRF, thereby supporting tedious and costly experimental identification of MemMoRFs. Our predictor utilizes a protein language model (pLM) which we processed to generate inputs to a deep convolutional neural network. We considered various pLMs (ESM-2, ProstT5, ProtT5 and Ankh) and applied feature selection to reduce their outputs, creating a more compact neural network model. pLMMoRF leverages the Ankh-based model, selected for its higher accuracy compared to our other models. Tests on low similarity test datasets demonstrate that pLMMoRF is more accurate than the sole current predictor of MemMoRFs, CoMemMoRFPred. Moreover, pLMMoRF has a relatively small computational footprint because of the compact network size and use of dedicated GPU nodes. This allowed us to make MemMoRF predictions for the human proteome. We analyzed these predictions and made them publicly available, facilitating an improved understanding of functions of membrane-coupled proteins. Our work underscores the importance of selecting key embedding features to enhance predictive performance and reduce computational footprint of sequence-based predictors of protein functions. The web server for the pLMMoRF predictor and the predictions for human proteins are freely available at https://plmmorf.hegelab.org.",

    "title": "Structure of an Unfavorable de Novo DNA Methylation Complex of Plant Methyltransferase ZMET2",
    "abstract": "DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mechanism that controls the assembly of heterochromatin and gene expression. In plants, DNA methylation occurs in both CG and non-CG contexts, with non-CG methylation showing notable substrate sequence dependence. The plant DNA methyltransferase CMT3 mediates maintenance of CHG (H = A, C, or T) DNA methylation, with a strong substrate preference for the hemimethylated CWG (W = A, T) motif. Yet, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here we present a crystal structure of ZMET2, the CMT3 ortholog from Zea mays (maize), in complex with a DNA substrate containing an unmethylated CTG motif and a histone peptide carrying a mimic of the histone H3K9me2 modification. Structural comparison of the ZMET2-CTG complex with the previously reported structure of ZMET2 bound to hemimethylated CAG DNA reveals similar but distinct protein-DNA interactions centered on the CWG motif, providing insight into the methylation state- and substrate sequence-specific ZMET2/CMT3-substrate interaction. Furthermore, our combined structural and biochemical analysis reveals a role for the +3-flanking base of the target cytosine in fine-tuning ZMET2-mediated DNA methylation and its functional interplay with the +1- and +2-flanking sites. Together, these results provide deep mechanistic insights into the substrate specificity of CMT3 DNA methyltransferases in plants.",

    "abstract": "Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) mediate many fundamental cellular processes. Control of PPIs through optically or chemically responsive protein domains has had a profound impact on basic research and some clinical applications. Most chemogenetic methods induce the association, i.e., dimerization or oligomerization, of target proteins, whilst the few available dissociation approaches either break large oligomeric protein clusters or heteromeric complexes. Here, we have exploited the controlled dissociation of a homodimeric oxidoreductase from mycobacteria (MSMEG_2027) by its native cofactor, F420, which is not present in mammals, as a bioorthogonal monomerization switch. Using X-ray crystallography, we found that in the absence of F420 MSMEG_2027 forms a unique domain-swapped dimer that occludes the cofactor binding site. Rearrangement of the N-terminal helix upon F420 binding results in the dissolution of the dimer. We then showed that MSMEG_2027 can be fused to proteins of interest in human cells and applied it as a tool to induce and release MAPK/ERK signalling downstream of a chimeric fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) tyrosine kinase. This F420-dependent chemogenetic de-homodimerization tool is stoichiometric and based on a single domain and thus represents a novel mechanism to investigate protein complexes in situ.",

Condensin contains Smc2 and Smc4, in which a coiled-coil arm tethers the hinge and head domains and dimerizes at the hinge. ATPs bind between the heads, induce their engagement, and are hydrolyzed to promote their disengagement. Previously, we performed solution atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging of yeast condensin holo-complex with ATP and conducted flexible molecular fitting, obtaining the hinge structure with open conformation. However, it has yet to be clarified how the opening/closing of the hinge is coupled to the ATP hydrolysis cycle. In this study, we performed solution AFM imaging in the presence and absence of varying nucleotides, including AMP-PNP, ATPγS, and ADP. Furthermore, we conducted molecular dynamics simulations of an Smc2/4 heterodimer and selected the structure best representing each AFM image. Our results suggested that head engagement upon ATP binding is coupled to hinge opening and that the N-terminal region of Brn1, one of the accessory subunits, re-associates to the Smc2 head after ADP release.",

Inadequate ChREBP activity impairs the cellular adaptations to glucose exposure and in humans associates with dyslipidemia, fatty liver disease, and type 2 diabetes. ChREBP activity is regulated by cytosolic-nuclear translocation involving its low-glucose inhibitory domain (LID). Whether this domain is targeted by post-translational lysine acetylation is unknown. Here we report a novel LID acetylation site that controls activity and protein interactions of ChREBP. Mutation of this residue increased glucose-induced activity and target gene expression of ChREBP. Mechanistically, mutant ChREBP protein showed more nuclear localization and enhanced genomic binding to a target promoter. Interactions with proteins that exhibit differential binding upon glucose exposure were attenuated by the mutation, demonstrating the importance of the LID in the formation of the protein interactome. Particularly interactions with 14-3-3 proteins, factors that regulate cytosolic/nuclear trafficking of ChREBP, were reduced, whereas interactions with proteins of the nucleosome remodeling deacetylase complex (NuRD) were increased.

    "abstract": "Microbes have been shown to be closely related to human health. In recent years, lots of computational methods for predicting microbial-drug association have been proposed. In this manuscript, we introduced a novel predictive model, called GTFKAN, to identify potential microbe-drug associations by combining Graph Transformation Networks (GTN) with Fourier Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (FKAN). In GTFKAN, we would first compute the Gaussian kernel and functional similarity of microbes and drugs respectively, and then adopt random walk and restart (RWR) methods to enhance these similar features to construct a new microbe-drug heterogeneous network HN. At the same time, we would further calculate the cosine similarity of microbes and diseases to construct another microbe-drug heterogeneous network LDIM. Next, we would input HN into GTN to derive the location and structural features of microorganisms and drugs, and input LDIM into FKAN to extract the hidden higher-order features of microorganisms and drugs, respectively. Finally, we would integrate these two features extracted by GTN and FKAN and feed the integrated features into the MLP classifier to infer potential microbial-drug associations. Moreover, to evaluate the performance of GTFKAN, we compared it with state-of-the-art methods based on well-known public datasets, and the experimental results show that GTFKAN can achieve satisfactory predictive performance. In addition, the results of ablation experiments and case studies also demonstrated the superiority of GTFKAN, which means that GTFKAN may be a useful microbial-drug association prediction tool in the future.",

    "abstract": "Nucleic acid base pairs interconvert between alternative conformations on a free energy landscape, and these dynamics play critical roles in recognition, folding, and catalysis. U–U and T–T mismatches can adopt two nearly isoenergetic wobble conformations, distinguished by their relative shearing displacements. Experimental NMR evidence suggests that these conformations dynamically interconvert in RNA motifs containing tandem U–U mismatches. However, whether such motions occur ubiquitously across U–U and T–T mismatches remains unknown, as high-resolution nucleic acid structures typically report only a single conformation. Here, we used NMR spectroscopy, a structure-based survey of the Protein Data Bank, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate wobble dynamics in U–U and T–T mismatches when flanked by canonical Watson-Crick base pairs in RNA and DNA duplexes. The structure-based survey revealed that U–U mismatches have propensities to adopt alternative wobble conformations even when controlling for sequence and identified potential intermediates along the wobble transition. Off-resonance R1ρ relaxation dispersion experiments detected no micro- to millisecond dynamics for U–U mismatches in duplex RNA and T–T mismatches in duplex DNA. However, alternative conformer refinement of the electron density in X-ray structures, inter-proton NOEs, carbonyl carbon chemical shifts, an RDC-derived conformational ensemble, and MD simulations indicated that U–U and T–T mismatches exist in a dynamic equilibrium between two wobble conformations, with the minor state exceeding 30% and the transitions occurring on the nanosecond timescale. Our findings suggest that U–U and T–T ubiquitously undergo sub-microsecond wobble motions, contributing to the energetic landscape and dynamic plasticity of nucleic acids, with important implications for processes that generate and act on these mismatches.",

    "title": "The Thiamin Pyrophosphate Riboswitch is Affected by Lysine-derived Metabolic Conversion Products in Escherichia coli",
    "abstract": "Riboswitches are 5′ untranslated regulators that control gene expression by specifically monitoring cellular metabolites. Metabolite binding to the riboswitch triggers the genetic regulation at the transcriptional or translational level. Riboswitches typically exhibit high affinities and strong discrimination against non-cognate metabolites, making them well suited to regulate gene expression. Importantly, despite the well characterized cellular processes ensuring metabolic conversion and recycling in bacteria, there is little information about how these processes influence riboswitch regulation mechanisms. Here, we characterize the regulation mechanisms of the lysine-sensing and thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP)-sensing riboswitches in E. coli. In agreement with previous results, our study indicates that the addition of lysine or TPP to the growth medium significantly reduces the expression of the respective riboswitch-regulated mRNAs. Surprisingly, we find that the addition of lysine also leads to a significant decrease in TPP-regulated mRNAs, suggesting that lysine indirectly affects TPP riboswitches. Using mutant strains from the Keio collection, we observe that the effect of lysine on TPP riboswitches is lost when perturbing the lysine degradation process. These data suggest that lysine degradation products may be used to generate TPP through metabolic conversion. In contrast, our results indicate that TPP does not modulate the regulation of the lysine riboswitch, suggesting that TPP does not indirectly affect the lysine riboswitch genetic control. Together, our results indicate that intracellular changes in lysine concentrations can be detected by TPP riboswitches, thus suggesting that riboswitches may be sensitive to cellular stress that are not directly related to their cognate metabolite.",

    "title": "The Crystal Structure and Biochemical Analyses of Escherichia coli YqgF Illuminate Its Diverse Functions",
    "abstract": "The Escherichia coli yqgF gene product is essential for bacterial growth and to confer resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents. Furthermore, additional evidence suggests that YqgF, a RuvC family protein, is required for DNA damage repair, yet the mechanism underlying its action remains elusive. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted structural and biochemical investigations on E. coli YqgF (EcYqgF). Here, we reveal that EcYqgF binds preferentially to branched DNA structures compared to single-stranded (ssDNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), and that the EcYqgF:DNA complexes formed with branched DNA species were more stable and resistant against high salt and excess of competitor DNA than those formed with dsDNA. We show that EcYqgF has a strong preference towards cleavage of branched DNA structures than dsDNA, ssDNA, and dsDNA with 5′- or 3′-ssDNA overhangs. Crucially, we found that EcYqgF has a DNA-independent, Mg2+-dependent ATPase activity that is tightly coupled to DNA cleavage. We have determined the crystal structure of EcYqgF, developed a model of ATP binding using AI-based methods, and rationalized the impact of site-directed mutants on ATP binding. Furthermore, we discovered two unusual ATPase-defective EcYqgF variants, proficient in ATP-binding but not hydrolysis, which display a modest increase in the DNA-binding affinity, yet are devoid of endonucleolytic activity, thus revealing a previously unappreciated property of YqgF endonucleases. Collectively, our results suggest that despite its overall structural similarity to the well-studied resolvase, RuvC, EcYqgF is functionally distinct. Importantly, the EcYqgF dual activity that couples ATP hydrolysis to endonuclease activity is absent in RuvC.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotes, at least three Pols (I, II, and III) are responsible for synthesizing unique RNA products. Many trans-acting factors affect the efficiency of transcription by the three Pols. Some of these factors influence more than one of the nuclear Pols. One such factor is polymerase-associated factor 1 complex (Paf1C). Paf1C, composed of five subunits in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), has been shown to promote transcription by Pols I and II and is conserved across eukaryotes. Although several studies have demonstrated that Paf1C associates with Pol I machinery, its roles in ribosomal RNA synthesis are not well-defined. In this study, we used native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq), to investigate the effect of the loss of two of the five Paf1C subunits (Paf1 and Cdc73) on Pol I occupancy at single-nucleotide resolution in yeast. We found that in both paf1Δ and cdc73Δ mutants, there was a significant reduction in Pol I occupancy at the 5′ end of the DNA template as compared to WT yeast, accompanied by other occupancy pattern changes throughout the gene. To complement these results, we also analyzed a PRO-seq dataset that was generated with DLD1 mammalian cells. Interestingly, we found that when Paf1C was knocked-down, there was also a reduction in the occupancy of Pol I at the 5′ end of the gene, consistent with our NET-seq analysis. Overall, our results support the conclusion that Paf1C is an important transcription elongation factor for Pol I and may play a conserved role across species.",

Using the unbiased ‘genome-first’ approach with integrated patient biobank databases, we identified KCNA3 gene variants associated with human disease and examined their impact on Kv1.3 channel biogenesis. Our tertiary and quaternary folding assays and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations show that KCNA3 gene variants in T1, the channel’s intersubunit recognition domain, manifest early-stage T1 folding defects, energetic instabilities, and conformational distortion of subunits concomitant with tertiary unwinding.

    "abstract": "HIV-1 integrase (IN) is targeted by two classes of antivirals: integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs), which bind to the active site within the catalytic core domain (CCD), and allosteric integrase inhibitors (ALLINIs), which bind at the CCD dimer interface. ALLINIs were initially designed to disrupt interactions with the cellular cofactor LEDGF/p75, but it has become clear that ALLINIs primarily act by promoting formation of aberrant integrase polymers. The ALLINIs achieve this by stabilizing ectopic intermolecular interactions between the CCD dimer and the integrase carboxy-terminal domain (CTD), which disrupts viral maturation. Previously, we determined the structure of full-length HIV-1 IN bound to the ALLINI GSK1264 at 4.4 Å resolution, revealing its polymerization mechanism. More recently, we reported the X-ray crystal structure of a minimal ternary complex between CCD, CTD, and the ALLINI BI-224436 at a higher resolution. In this study, we improve the original 4.4 Å structure using this higher-resolution information and report two new structures of full-length HIV-1 IN harboring escape mutations in the CCD (Trp131Cys) or CTD (Asn222Lys) bound with the prototype ALLINI BI-D at 4.5 Å. These structures reveal perturbations to the tertiary organization associated with escape substitutions, which correlate with their reduced ability to form ectopic ALLINI-induced polymers in vitro. These findings suggest a general structural mechanism of ALLINI resistance and provide insights for the design of improved ALLINIs.",

Based on 176 million high confidence (pLDDT > 70) AlphaFold-predicted protein models and a detailed analysis of the conservation of the motif in a family, we found four new lasso motifs, including L4 and LS4LS3 topologies, and the first examples of knotted lasso proteins: L1K31 and L3#K31. We show that in the case of natural proteins, there are no lassos with 5 threadings, but there exist some with 6. Families possessing proteins with more than 6 threadings did not exceed the conservation threshold of 10%. Moreover, we propose a probable folding mechanism for the LS4LS3 lasso motif, enhancing our view on protein folding and stability. This work expands the topological space of lasso type motifs in proteins but also suggests that more complex structures could be unfavorable for proteins.",

Most of the ∼1500 proteins of the mitochondrial proteome are encoded in the nuclear genome, synthesized in the cytosol, and actively transported into mitochondria. The proteasome, a major cellular proteolytic machinery, plays an important role in the quality control of their transport by degradation of inefficiently imported mitochondrial proteins in the cytosol. Proteasome inhibition by bortezomib was described as a strategy to alleviate deficiencies stemming from an inefficient import of proteins into the mitochondria. Notably, an impairment of the respiratory complexes was shown to induce a rearrangement of the proteasome composition to incorporate some of the immunoproteasome catalytic subunits, such as PSMB9. In this study, we demonstrated that targeting immunoproteasome inhibited degradation, and thus restored the abundance of inefficiently imported respiratory complex IV proteins in the patient derived fibroblasts. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the immunoproteasome-specific inhibitors displayed a decreased toxicity compared to bortezomib.

    "abstract": "Methionine aminopeptidase (MetAP) is a vital metalloprotease that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by binding to the 70S ribosome at the peptide exit tunnel and removing the N-terminal methionine from nascent polypeptide chains. In Escherichia coli, a single subclass of type 1 MetAP is present, whereas mycobacteria possess two subclasses, MetAP1a and MetAP1c. The key difference between these two is the presence of an additional 40 amino acid-long N-terminal extension in MetAP1c, which may contribute to distinct functional properties. In this study, we have uncovered a previously unrecognized “moonlighting” function of MetAP1c in mycobacteria. Interestingly, our results show that MetAP1c expression is specifically enhanced during the stationary phase of bacterial growth. Moreover, we identify a unique interaction between MetAP1c and the 30S ribosomal subunit, revealing its distinctive affinity for the small subunit. A 4.7 Å cryo-EM map of the Mycobacterium smegmatis MetAP1c-30S subunit complex demonstrates for the first time that MetAP1c binds at the inter-subunit face of the 30S subunit head region. The binding of MetAP1c induces conformational changes in the 30S subunit, impairing its ability to associate with the 50S subunit, thus imparting an anti-association property to MetAP1c. To further understand the role of the N-terminal extension, we constructed two mutant variants of MetAP1c, which confirmed its critical involvement in this moonlighting function. This anti-association activity of MetAP1c is likely one of the energy conservation mechanisms in mycobacteria where MetAP1c is involved in translation down regulation during stationary phase.",

    "abstract": "Filamin A (FLNA) is an actin cross-linking protein that connects multiple transmembrane receptors and cytosolic signaling proteins to regulate cell shape, motility, and signaling. Our previous report has shown that FLNA interacts directly with the La-related protein 4 (LARP4) and this interaction is essential for cell migration. Here, using the x-ray crystallography and protein–protein interaction studies, we investigated the molecular basis of LARP4 binding to FLNA. We described the high-resolution structure of the FLNA immunoglobulin-like repeat 21 (R21) and its complex with the LARP4 peptide. The FLNA-binding site in LARP4 is localized between Ala269 and Asn281, where it forms an extended β strand that interacts with the cleft formed by β strands C and D of FLNA R21. Consistent with this structure, the A279Cfs*2 mutation found in catalogue of somatic mutations in cancer (COSMIC) database and the experimentally introduced F277A mutation both disrupt LARP4 binding to FLNA. In contrast, the COSMIC-listed N275S mutation alters LARP4 membrane localization without affecting FLNA interaction, suggesting distinct functional outcomes. Cell migration assays showed that LARP4-knockdown cells expressing FLNA-binding-deficient mutants migrated faster than those expressing wild-type LARP4. The LARP4-binding site on FLNA overlaps with the β-integrin tail-binding region, and in vitro assays revealed that LARP4 can compete with integrin β7 tails for FLNA R21 binding. These results suggest that the LARP4–FLNA interaction may regulate cell migration, at least in part, by competing with integrin tails, although this mechanism has yet to be confirmed in vivo.",

We subsequently identified a pan-neutralizing antibody (ICO-hu104) with the predicted epitope, however, as the epitope was somewhat distant from the hACE2 binding interface, and our previous work limited to the spike RBD, the neutralization mechanism was unclear. Using HDX-MS, we investigated the binding of ICO-hu104 to the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein from Wuhan, Delta and Omicron variants. We demonstrate that binding of ICO-hu104 results in an increase in deuterium uptake in the distant HR1 domain in latter variants, which in a biological context could be indicative of destabilisation of the helices within this region, promoting premature S1 shedding or failure of helical extension during S2-mediated fusion. This is supported by our computational modelling, highlighting propagation of allosteric effects to the S2 coiled-coil region upon rigidification of the ICO-hu104 epitope. Collectively, this work demonstrates an alternative neutralization mechanism for ICO-hu104 which is distinct from its first-generation predecessors and thus opens alternative avenues targeting non-RBD epitopes through allosteric perturbations.",

    "abstract": "Tau297–391 (dGAE) forms paired helical filaments in vitro that resemble those deposited in Alzheimer’s disease brain tissue. We have previously shown that hydromethylthionine (HMT) has the ability to inhibit dGAE self-assembly at sub-stoichiometric ratios. Here, we examined two regions of tau within the core filament-forming region that possess high self-assembly propensity sequences and have explored their ability to form filaments and whether their self-assembly can be inhibited by HMT. We confirm that tau306–323 self-assembles to form filaments but that fibrillogenesis is not inhibited by HMT. Previous work by others has shown that tau350–362 (PAM4) forms assemblies that recapitulate the C-shaped structure of paired helical filaments. Here, a chiral spectral circular dichroism fingerprint shows that HMT binds to tau350–362 and we reveal that HMT inhibits assembly. We conclude that the region important for assembly and inhibition is formed by the inner C-shaped region of tau and suggest that the central region involved in filament assembly may associate with HMT to prevent self-assembly.",

    "title": "Human Rhinovirus B14 with Non-functional Drug-binding Pockets Recovers Infectivity through Stereochemically Constrained Mutations that Restore Capsid Flexibility",
    "abstract": "Human rhinovirus (RV) is one of the most frequent human pathogens. As causative agents of most common colds, RVs originate serious socioeconomic problems, and they are also associated to or exacerbate severe respiratory diseases. No anti-rhinoviral drugs or vaccines are available yet. In this study, amino acid residues that delimit a druggable pocket in the RV capsid were individually replaced by larger residues, which in most cases resulted in impaired virus infectivity. After serial infections of human host cells, the hampered mutant viruses invariably recovered full infectivity. Sequencing of the viral progeny revealed that, contrary to what has been observed when deleterious mutations were introduced in other virus capsid regions, those mutant RVs did not regain infectivity through the fixation of second-site mutations. Instead, infectivity was always recovered through reversion or pseudo-reversion events that replaced the deleterious bulky residue with a smaller residue, even though this strategy required, in some cases, the improbable fixation of two nucleotides in the corresponding codon. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations and determination of mechanical elasticity by atomic force microscopy revealed that the small-to-large, deleterious mutations reduced the capsid conformational flexibility; and the large-to-small, infectivity-restoring (pseudo)reversions led to recovery of the capsid flexibility. The stereochemistry of this druggable hydrophobic pocket in RV appears to be biologically constrained: The deleterious effect of reducing pocket volume and capsid flexibility is reverted during virus propagation only through same-site mutations that restore pocket volume and capsid flexibility. These constraints may help the further development of anti-RV drugs.",

    "abstract": "Ubiquitylation is a critical post-translational modification that is required for cell vitality. Attachment of ubiquitin is complex, with the fate of ubiquitylated proteins determined by the length of the attached ubiquitin chains and the nature of the linkage used to build the chains. Many E3 ligases attach ubiquitin chains of different types to substrate proteins in a context specific manner, but the molecular details of how E3 ligases specify chains of different types is poorly understood. Arkadia/RNF111 is a large RING E3 ligase that modifies some substrates with degradative ubiquitin chains, while other substrates are modified with non-degradative ubiquitin chains. Here, using Arkadia and the related E3 ligase, Ark2C, we characterize the RING-E2 complexes that promote assembly of ubiquitin chains of distinct linkages. Our structural studies highlight the conserved nature of the RING-E2 interface, while our binding and activity assays reveal several different E2 enzymes that functionally interact with Ark2C and Arkadia. Using Arkadia, substrate ubiquitylation assays reveal differences in the ability for substrates to be modified, with the E2 enzymes Ubc13 and Ube2K requiring addition of a ‘priming’ ubiquitin molecule before subsequent modification can occur. We also show that substrates that bind Arkadia tightly are more extensively modified, and that prior substrate ubiquitylation enhances subsequent modification. While further studies will be required to understand how RING-E2 pairing is modulated in cells, this study advances our understanding of E2 recruitment and chain assembly by Arkadia and provides tools that may help dissect cellular function.",

    "abstract": "The F-ATP synthase subunit Oligomycin Sensitivity Conferral Protein (OSCP) contributes to the structural and functional coupling between the F1 catalytic and the FO transmembrane domains of the synthase. A body of literature suggests that OSCP is also a potential pharmacological target, as it mediates interactions with both proteins and small molecules capable of influencing ATP synthase activity and mitochondrial Permeability Transition (PT). However, the possibility of further exploring this aspect has been so far hindered by the poor properties of the isolated protein in solution, as reported by previous studies. Here, we use an integrated approach based on Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) and Mass Spectrometry under native conditions (nMS) to demonstrate that the isolated OSCP subunit is not affected by nonspecific aggregation, but it is involved in a dimerization equilibrium. By the analysis of the anchoring region between the OSCP subunit and the b subunit of the ATP synthase, we identified a peptide mimicking the sequence of the C-terminal helix of the b subunit (b-CT) and capable to interfere with the OSCP dimerization equilibrium, stabilizing the monomeric state of the protein. This study offers valuable insights on the structural properties of the isolated OSCP subunit in solution, opening new avenues for future pharmacological studies and a more thorough comprehension of the emerging therapeutic potential of this protein.",

Notably, ’ CELyTED ’ enables the introduction of large-sized DNA plasmids exceeding 50 kb into target microorganisms mitigating the potential adverse effects of physical shearing during the purification process. This simplicity in the delivery protocol makes it versatile for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms, establishing a fundamental platform in the synthetic genome field.

    "title": "ATP as a Key Modulator of Fused-in-sarcoma Phase Separation and Aggregation: Insights into Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Pathogenesis",
    "abstract": "Fused in sarcoma (FUS) is an RNA-binding protein, the aberrant aggregation of which is linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) of FUS facilitates functional condensate formation and can drive pathological aggregation under certain conditions. The aggregation-inhibitory effects of ATP, a key cellular hydrotrope, have been reported for multiple proteins; however, how ATP, present at approximately 1–12 mM concentrations in cells, regulates LLPS and amyloid fibril formation remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated how ATP modulates the LLPS behavior and aggregation of FUS and its ALS-linked variants, R495X and P525L. ATP destabilized both normal LLPS and aberrant high-pressure LLPS (HP-LLPS), with a relatively strong inhibitory effect on HP-LLPS. Pressure-jump experiments demonstrated that ATP reduced the irreversible aggregation propensity of HP-LLPS, particularly in ALS variants that exhibited enhanced aggregation compared to that by wild-type FUS. Molecular dynamic simulations further revealed that the triphosphate and adenosine moieties of ATP synergistically disrupted intermolecular interactions that were crucial for phase separation, leveraging its amphipathic properties. Notably, ATP concentrations within the physiological range (1–12 mM) significantly inhibited FUS aggregation, suggesting a protective role in cellular environments. These results indicate that decreased intracellular ATP levels may exacerbate aberrant phase transitions of FUS, contributing to ALS onset. This study underscores the potential of ATP as a therapeutic modulator of protein phase separation and aggregation, providing valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of ALS. Our findings open new avenues for targeting ATP-regulated pathways for treating neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "abstract": "C9ORF72 hexanucleotide expansion is the most common genetic mutation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTD). This expansion can be translated into dipeptide repeats (DPRs) through repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translation. Arginine-rich DPRs, i.e., poly-glycine arginine (poly-GR) and poly-proline arginine (poly-PR) are considered the most toxic ones among the five types of DPRs. We recently discovered that poly-GR forms helical conformation and is able to penetrate cell membranes, leading to cytotoxicity, but the mechanism remains unclear. Here, we investigated the membrane disruption mechanism of poly-GR related to its sequence and membrane composition. To test this, we stopped its continuously repeated sequence by inserting several proline residues to disrupt its helical structure. We found that the modification reduced its cytotoxicity and membrane disruption capability. Next, we examined the influence of lipid composition on the membrane-disrupting ability of poly-GR using various liposomes. Poly-GR caused higher leakage in the negatively charged liposomes compared to the neutral or positively charged ones. Cholesterol content affected the extent of disruption, while gangliosides had no significant effect. Using small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, and atomic force microscopy (AFM), we observed the behavior of poly-GR on lipid membranes. Finally, we directly treated mouse neuroblastoma to modulate the cholesterol content and found that cholesterol depletion inhibited the internalization of poly-GR into the cells and reduced cytotoxicity. These findings reveal that the conformation of poly-GR and the lipid composition influence its membrane penetration, offering insights into potential therapeutic strategies for C9ORF72-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cells need to implement and maintain molecular mechanisms relying on an energy trade-off between resistance and key functions to survive. Among them, changes in lipid metabolism are crucial. Phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidic acid (PA) are some of the lipids forming cell membranes and having key functions in lipid metabolism. PADI4 is an enzyme implicated in the conversion of arginine to citrulline (citrullination), that has been related with the development of several types of cancers. In this work, we report the lipid binding properties of PADI4. Such binding was assayed in vitro against zwitterionic (PC) and anionic (PA and PS) lipids, and it was monitored by several biophysical techniques. Furthermore, results in silico showed that the binding of PADI4 with PA, PC and PS occurred at the active site of the enzyme. This binding was confirmed in cellulo by using PS as the target lipid, employing immunofluorescence (IF) and proximity ligation assay (PLA) in different cancer cell lines. The use in cellulo of a specific enzymatic inhibitor of PADI4, GSK484, abolished the binding between PADI4 and PS in cancer cells, further indicating that their interaction occurred at the protein active site. Altogether, this work shows that PADI4 was capable of binding to lipids, and opens the venue to study the role that it could be playing in deimination processes and cancer development. Moreover, this study lays the foundation for developing novel cancer therapies from new perspectives, based on the interaction of lipids with citrullinating enzymes.",

Furthermore, it appears to be involved in human oncogenesis through cytokinesis-independent mechanisms and has been reported to be essential for nuclear translocation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins, including the oncoprotein STAT3. Here we utilized MgcRacGAP inhibitor compound 1 (MINC1), a small molecule inhibitor of MgcRacGAP, to further investigate how MgcRacGAP regulates STAT3. Surprisingly, both MINC1 treatment and small interference RNA (siRNA)-mediated gene silencing of MgcRacGAP resulted in increased STAT3 phosphorylation and STAT3-driven transcriptional activity in our experimental systems. Finally, we demonstrated that MINC1-induced STAT3 activation likely is due to increased STAT3 phosphorylation caused by a Rac1-PAR3-IL6-IL6R-JAK2 mediated autocrine/paracrine mechanism.",

The resulting structure was used to map known protein–protein interactions enriched with in silico predictions. An interaction network model for collagen V was created.

This study compared the activity of three histone-derived antimicrobial peptides—buforin II, DesHDAP1, and parasin—with variants that contain only lysine or arginine cationic residues. These peptides operate via different mechanisms as parasin causes membrane permeabilization while buforin II and DesHDAP1 translocate into bacteria. For all peptides, antibacterial activity increased with increased arginine content. Higher arginine content increased permeabilization for parasin while it improved translocation for buforin II and DesHDAP1.

Conventional protein kinase C enzymes (PKCs), as exemplified by PKCβII, selectively inhibit internalization of dopamine D2 receptor and β2 adrenoceptor in a β-arrestin- but not GRK2-dependent manner. PKCβII interacts with β-arrestin2 upon autophosphorylation at T250, and inhibits the receptor internalization by decreasing the ubiquitination of β-arrestin2. PKCβII interferes with the interaction between β-arrestin2 and MDM2 in the cytosol, resulting in the redistribution of MDM2 to the nucleus. Subsequently, deubiquitination of β-arrestin2 and inhibition of agonist-induced receptor internalization follow. Thus, our study suggests that the extent of β-arrestin ubiquitination and the autophosphorylation status of PKCs determine PKCβII-mediated inhibition of homologous regulatory processes of GPCRs.",

    "abstract": "It has been reported that cystatin c (Cys C) closely correlates with metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes. However, it is still unknown whether Cys C plays a role for these disorders. Our results showed that the insulin signal transduction was largely impaired by Cys C in hepatocytes. In myotubes, however, the insulin signal transduction was not affected. Following experiments revealed that Cys C could induce endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) in hepatocytes, whereas Cys C had no such an effect in myotubes. The alleviation of ER stress by 4-Phenyl butyric acid (4-PBA) restored the impaired insulin signal transduction in Cys C-treated hepatocytes. These results provided direct evidence that, by inducing ER stress, Cys C impairs insulin signal transduction in hepatocytes.",

Also, WWOX wild type (WT), but not WWOX SUMO mutant (K176A) markedly reduced both DU145 prostate cancer cell proliferation and xenograft tumorigenesis.

We investigated the effects of Hcy on fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4), and tested our hypothesis that Hcy-induced atherosclerosis is mediated by increased FABP4 expression and decreased methylation. The FABP4 expression and DNA methylation was assessed in the aorta of ApoE−/− mice fed high-methionine diet for 20 weeks. Over-expression of FABP4 enhanced accumulation of total cholesterol and cholesterol ester in foam cells. The up-regulation of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) promoted the methylation process and decreased FABP4 expression.

Although many studies have suggested a contribution to carcinogenesis, it is still unclear whether the aberrant DNA hypomethylation observed in tumors is a consequence or a cause of cancer. Here, we show that the enforced expression of Stella (also known as PGC7 and Dppa3) induced not only global DNA demethylation but also transformation of NIH3T3 cells. Furthermore, overexpression of Stella enhanced the metastatic ability of B16 melanoma cells, presumably through the induction of metastasis-related genes. These results provide new insights into the function of global DNA hypomethylation in carcinogenesis.",

Detailed analyses of this map revealed novel associations.

However, only a small percentage of p65 is cleaved during apoptosis, not in proportion to the dramatic reduction in NF-κB transactivation. Here we show that the p651-97 fragment generated by Caspase-3 cleavage interferes with ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3), an NF-κB “specifier” subunit, and selectively retards the nuclear translocation of RPS3, thus dampening the RPS3/NF-κB-dependent anti-apoptotic gene expression. Our findings reveal a novel cell fate determination mechanism to ensure cells undergo programed cell death through interfering with RPS3/NF-κB-conferred anti-apoptotic transcription by the fragment from partial p65 cleavage by activated Caspase-3.",

    "title": "Channel matters: Overcoming diffusion bottlenecks via loop engineering of LinD for enhanced isoprene production",
    "abstract": "The selective chemical dehydration leading to CC double bond formation is a challenging reaction that harbors great potential for industrial applications. The cofactor independent bifunctional linalool dehydratase isomerase (LinD) from Castellaniella defragrans catalyzes the reversible dehydration of (S)-linalool to myrcene, as well as its isomerization to geraniol. We previously reported that LinD is able to convert the small alkenol 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol to the valuable product isoprene. To foster the LinD-catalyzed production of isoprene in a novel recombinant E. coli whole-cell two-phase system, we targeted the active site and a flexible α-helix near the putative substrate channel via enzyme engineering. Interestingly, none of the active site variants exhibited an increased product formation. In contrast, saturation mutagenesis of the 10 amino acids forming the α-helix, identified the variants K103N, R104G, G107T and D112T, which exhibited a 1.73 ± 0.05, 1.56 ± 0.12, 2.08 ± 0.12 and 1.93 ± 0.06-fold increase in product formation compared to the wild-type enzyme, respectively. Notably, a combinatorial approach targeting these four variants led to decreased activity in all cases, compared to the corresponding single-point variants, indicating negative epistatic interactions. Thus, employing the most catalytically efficient single point variant G107T, which exhibited a 28-fold higher kcat (app) compared to the wild-type, a total of 2.8 ± 0.2 mM isoprene was obtained utilizing the whole-cell two-phase system. Crystallographic analysis of G107T revealed only minor structural changes; however, molecular dynamic simulations uncovered striking conformational differences relative to the LinD wild-type, emphasizing the role of altered substrate channel in variant G107T.",

    "abstract": "In the field of biocatalysis, enzymes play a crucial role. However, they are faced with many challenges in practical applications, such as poor operational stability, high production costs and difficulties in recycling. Therefore, the efficient separation, purification and immobilization of enzymes are key to realize their industrial application. In this experiment, Elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) tags with different sequence lengths, (VPGVG)n = 30, 40, 50, were designed to be fused with β-glucosidase (Glu) for expression. The temperature-responsive properties of ELPs have been utilized to achieve efficient separation and purification of recombinant enzymes, significantly improving the purification efficiency. Furthermore, the immobilization of Glu was achieved by enhancing the adsorption force between the recombinant enzyme and the carrier material based on the hydrophobicity of the ELPs. Compared to the free Glu, the immobilized Glu exhibited excellent thermal stability, pH stability, reusability and storage stability. In the catalytic hydrolysis of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), the glycosylation rate was increased by 27.26–28.05 % due to the synergistic action of immobilized Glu and cellulase. Therefore, this study developed an integrated method combining separation, purification with immobilization based on recombinant enzymes with ELPs, aiming to enhance the industrial application of immobilized enzymes.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical wounding, a significant cause of yield loss in agricultural crops, has prompted recent efforts to identify effective solutions, such as applying biostimulants that not only improve plant growth but also enhance resistance to mechanical damage. This study evaluates the combined effects of alginate (Al-1, 0.75 mg mL−1), salicylic acid (SA, 100 µM), and chitosan (Ch, 0.75 mg mL−1) on tomato plant growth, biochemical responses, and recovery from mechanical wounding. The results indicate that Al-1 accumulates at the plant cell wall, transitioning from a liquid to a film-like state. During this process, Al-1 also loses over 50 % of its sodium ions and fails to acquire nitrogen ions from Ch. However, the combined application of Al-1, SA, and Ch significantly promotes plant growth and enhances mechanical stress resistance by increasing chlorophyll, sugar, protein, and carotenoid levels, as well as improving xylem development compared to other treatments. Furthermore, the Al-1 +Ch+SA combination elevates H2O2 levels and APX activity in adjacent leaves 60 min after wounding; although this response is delayed compared to a individual treatments. These findings suggest that this combination of biostimulants enhances plant resilience to mechanical injury, offering potential for improving crop yield and quality in stress-prone agricultural systems",

    "abstract": "Recombineering, a technique derived from phage-encoded homologous recombination, has emerged as a vital approach for bacterial genome engineering. Agrobacterium tumefaciens is extensively utilized to transfer DNA into the host plant genomes. To facilitate the transformation of various plant species, particularly those of considerable economic value, genetic modifications of Agrobacterium strains are essential. Our previous studies established an Agrobacterium-specific phage-encoded homologous recombination system for Agrobacterium species. Yet, recent investigations have indicated that there is a substantial variability in the recombination efficiency of these recombineering systems for gene editing across different genome loci in A. tumefaciens. In this work, we present the development of an efficient genome engineering tool for A. tumefaciens by integrating recombineering with CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Initially, we found that lengthening the homology arms significantly enhanced genome editing efficiency. Nevertheless, at certain genomic sites, even when the length of the homology arms was increased, the editing efficiency remained suboptimal. Subsequently, combination of the Agrobacterium-specific recombineering system with the CRISPR/Cas9 system markedly enhanced the genome engineering efficiency. This study offers an enhanced and efficient genome engineering tool for A. tumefaciens, which could potentially be applied to other species within the Agrobacterium genus.",

    "abstract": "This report uses fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to explore protein-protein interactions and the relative priorities of Bcl-2 family proteins in living cells, focusing on four proteins: Mcl-1, Bak, BimL and Puma. FRET analysis of cells coexpressing CFP-Mcl-1 and YFP-Bak/Puma/BimL demonstrates the direct binding of Mcl-1 to Bak/Puma/BimL. We constructed Bak-P2A-CFP-Mcl-1, BimL-P2A-CFP-Mcl-1, and Puma-P2A-CFP-Mcl-1 plasmids to achieve the co-expression of Bak/Puma/BimL and Mcl-1. FRET analysis for the cells coexpressing Bak-P2A-CFP-Mcl-1 and YFP-Puma/BimL shows that co-expression of Bak and Mcl-1 significantly increased the EDmax values between CFP-Mcl-1 and YFP-Puma/BimL, indicating that Bak makes the sites of Mcl-1 and Puma/BimL close by inserting into the Mcl-1-Puma/BimL dimers to form Bak-Mcl-1-Puma/BimL trimers, which has also been further verified by Co-IP analysis. For the cells coexpressing Puma/BimL-P2A-CFP-Mcl-1 and YFP-Bak, the ED values between Mcl-1 and Bak were very small, demonstrating that Mcl-1 binds preferentially to Puma or BimL in the presence of both Puma or BimL and Bak. Collectively, Puma/BimL preferentially binds to Mcl-1 to form Mcl-1-Puma and Mcl-1-BimL dimers, and Bak can insert into the Mcl-1-Puma and Mcl-1-BimL hetero-dimers to form hetero-trimers (Bak-Mcl-1-Puma and Bak-Mcl-1-BimL).",

    "abstract": "Exogenous RNA interference (exoRNAi) has emerged as a promising tool for gene silencing in plants, yet a robust and efficient exoRNAi technology remains elusive. Here we evaluated a Loop-ended dsRNA (ledRNA) design for enhancing exoRNAi efficacy. ledRNA has a dumbbell-like structure, consisting of a long dsRNA stem flanked by single-stranded loops, with a nick site at the dsRNA stem. When topically applied to leaves, cotyledons, meristems or roots, the ledRNA accumulated at higher levels than traditional hairpin RNA (hpRNA) both in the treated tissues (leaf, cotyledon, roots) and untreated tissues (adjacent leaf areas and remote cotyledons and roots). This suggests that ledRNA possesses greater stability and more efficient uptake and movement in plants than the traditional RNAi molecules. Topically delivered ledRNA induced stronger silencing of the endogenous FAD2 gene in N. benthamiana leaves, leading to increased accumulation of monounsaturated fatty acids. Beyond plants, ledRNA also exhibited RNAi activity in diverse kingdoms of life. When introduced into cultures of the fungus Fusarium oxysporum, ledRNA effectively and specifically downregulated expression of the FoCYP51A, FoCYP51B, FoCYP51C, FoSDHB, FoSDHC and FoSDHD genes in the fungal cells. Additionally, oral ingestion of ledRNA targeting the critical MpRack-1 gene by green peach aphids (Myzus persicae) significantly reduced their fecundity, leading to a 75 % decrease in progeny production. These findings highlight ledRNA as a promising tool for enhancing the efficacy of exoRNAi-based manipulation of gene expression.",

Consequently, various genetic engineering methods have been explored. While sacB-based homologous recombination (HR) and CRISPR-Cas9 have shown both advantages and disadvantages in C. necator, alternative tools, including the DNA endonuclease I-SceI-mediated HR system could enable precise, scarless genome editing without requiring a large database. We developed a two-plasmid-based I-SceI HR system for efficient gene deletion and insertion in C. necator by altering origin replication and induction systems. The pOUO-1 plasmid was designed for conjugation-based genome integration via first HR, whereas the pOH-4 plasmid was constructed to express I-SceI, inducing second HR. Unlike conventional I-SceI expression strategies, which fail to trigger second HR in C. necator, transformation with pOH-4 alone was sufficient for recombination. A plasmid-curing strategy was optimized to eliminate the highly stable pOH-4 by increasing the incubation temperature to 37°C. Using this optimized system, the phaC1 gene was successfully knocked out; the phaCBP-M-CPF4 was inserted at the same site, resulting in a novel poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-5-hydroxyvalerate)-producing strain. This newly established I-SceI HR technique significantly simplifies genome engineering in C. necator, reducing the timeframe to a few weeks and facilitating its further applications in synthetic biology.",

In our previous study, we successfully expressed insulin in Pseudomonas fluorescens. We observed that lowering the post-induction temperature enhanced the soluble fraction; however, it resulted in lower protein titer. In this study, the individual and synergistic effects of multiple chaperones and signal peptides on soluble protein synthesis are analyzed. A plasmid with a spectinomycin antibiotic resistance encoding gene was constructed for co-expression of chaperones. The combined effect of Disulphide bond protein A (DsbA) and phosphate binding protein (Pbp) resulted in ∼60 % of the fusion protein in soluble form. A comprehensive study was performed to assess the influence of the location of the His-tag on the expression and solubility of the protein. A high-copy origin of replication (ori) produced a lower soluble protein titer and caused a significantly longer lag phase. Under optimal concentration of antibiotics and inducer, inoculation percentage and induction OD600, the protein and soluble protein fraction titer increased by ∼58 % and ∼27 %, respectively. In a batch bioreactor, a maximum of 234.58 mg/l fusion protein with 71.59 % solubility and around 15 % of the total soluble protein fraction in the culture supernatant was obtained. Circular dichroism analysis revealed that the secondary structure of the purified insulin was comparable to that of the standard insulin.

    "abstract": "This study presents a novel hybrid computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model that integrates hydrodynamics, kinetics, and auxiliary control systems for a mammalian bioprocess across scales. The CFD model simulates the entire 14-day bioprocess at three different scales (250 mL, 1000 L, and 2000 L). The combination of hydrodynamic and kinetic assessment at each timestep allows for an optimization of feed delivery and implementation of feed control systems, with PID parameters tuned within the simulation, resulting in computational methods for bioreactor optimization. Using this model and CHO fed-batch experimental data, this study reveals the cell growth profile was minimally sensitive to glucose concentration, while glutamine concentration had a large impact. This model’s scale-up utility is demonstrated by showing similar cell growth profiles across scales by tuning feeding rates. This assessment was completed in one-tenth of the time typically required to simulate such a process by leveraging the time scale difference between “fast” fluid dynamics and “slow” cell kinetics.",

However, the limited efficiency of methanol utilization hampers methanol-based biomanufacturing in microorganisms. This study focuses on enhancing methanol utilization efficiency in Komagataella phaffii through the implementation of a novel alcohol-aldehyde conversion system based on the Adh900 protein. Results indicate a notable 14 % increase in biomass compared to the wild-type strain. Furthermore, analysis of the amino acid metabolism pathway underscores the significance of histidine in facilitating the methanol utilization pathway (MUTP). By combination of adding 120 mg/L histidine to the medium and optimizing promoter strategies, the dry cell weight (DCW) was up to 4.33 g DCW/L, which was increased by 63 %. The combination of these strategies has important research significance for methanol-based biological metabolism, and will further promote the microbial application of methanol.

    "abstract": "Phenylpyruvic acid, as a versatile organic acid, has attracted widespread attention in the fields of food, feed, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics for its synthetic methods. In this study, we co-expressed L-amino acid oxidase, D-lactate dehydrogenase, and glucose dehydrogenase in Escherichia coli. The resulting recombinant whole-cell biocatalysts exhibited high efficiency in the cascade enzymatic synthesis of D-phenyllactic acid from L-phenylalanine. However, their limitations in operational stability and reusability have impeded their broader application. To address this issue, the co-expressing bacteria was immobilized on the metal-organic framework (MOF) ZIF-90. The encapsulation rate of the immobilized E. coli cells (E. coli@ZIF-90) and the recovery rate of their catalytic activity were 94.8 % and 92.7 %, respectively. The physical and biochemical properties of the E. coli@ZIF-90 were subsequently studied in detail. Compared with free cells, E. coli@ZIF-90 demonstrates superior stability under acidic and alkaline conditions, enhanced thermal stability, and increased tolerance to metal ions and organic reagents. After storage at 4°C for 8 days, the residual enzyme activity of the immobilized cells is still over 75 %, which is about 1.7 times that of free cells. Following 10 cycles of biocatalytic reactions, the immobilized cells maintained over 80 % of their enzyme activity, contrasting with the 58.6 % residual activity observed in free cells. In the enzyme cascade reaction catalyzed by E. coli@ZIF-90, 25 g·l−1 L-PHE was completely reacted to produce D-PLA 17.8 g·l−1, with an enantiomeric excess (e.e.) greater than 99.5 %. This study provides a promising method for obtaining efficient and robust biocatalysts for the biosynthesis of D-PLA.

Here, we report a flow cytometry-based method for potency assessment of the Rotarix rotavirus vaccine.

Determination of adequate cell seeding timepoint, target cell concentration and endpoint after infection are key parameters for the precision, robustness, and accuracy of titer determination. We established optimized assay conditions for lyophilized and final vaccine formulations. Data from both workflows are in line with the CCID50 range of concentrations.

In this study, the transformation efficiency of Chlorella pyrenoidosa (C. pyrenoidosa) was investigated during Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, and an efficient transformation system was established. L-lactate dehydrogenases (LLDHs) from Bos taurus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Bacillus coagulans were successfully integrated into C. pyrenoidosa, and the expression of the target genes was confirmed through RT-PCR and enzyme activity assays. The engineered strains expressing BCLLDH, LPLLDH, and BTLLDH produced L-lactic acid titers of 76.64 mg/L, 153.18 mg/L, and 98.21 mg/L, respectively, and their transgenic stability was verified. Homology modeling of the three LLDHs was performed, and molecular docking with pyruvate was conducted to investigate the interaction mechanism.

This technology enables the development of customized structures with various geometries and properties (shape, size, porosity, density, and roughness). This study produced carrier beads using fused filament fabrication with two different thermopolymers: acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA). The carrier beads were printed with three distinct millipore geometries—hexagonal, square, and triangular—to evaluate immobilizing Gluconobacter oxydans' efficiency and investigate how immobilization varies based on the material type and millipore geometry. ABS exhibited greater surface roughness compared to PLA, which enhanced cell immobilization. The highest cell immobilization efficiencies were achieved with the ABS beads, with the hexagonal millipore geometry demonstrating the best efficiency at 84.7 %. Determining mechanical parameters, including storage and loss modulus, is essential for ensuring the durability of the beads in industrial processes. The glass transition temperatures for ABS and PLA were found to be 105 °C and 60 °C to 65 °C, respectively.

B. thailandensis E264 was grown in triplicate for nine days at 30 °C, extracted using ethyl acetate, and analysed using LC/Q-TOF/MS. Results showed 84 RL congeners with different adducts were annotated. Cultures with glycerol primarily produced di-RLs with carbon chain lengths from C12:2 to C16-C14, whereas cultures with oleic acid produced mono-RLs (C8:2 to C16-C16). Multivariate analysis of PLS-DA revealed distinct RL profiles in response to different carbon sources, with di-RL-C10-C12 (VIP = 2.15) and mono-RL-C10-C14:1 (VIP = 1.90) identified as key congeners in the glycerol and oleic acid cultures, respectively. The heatmap highlighted significant fold changes in RL congener abundance (2.94-fold higher di-RL-C14 in glycerol culture and 4.38-fold higher mono-RL-C8-C10 in oleic acid culture).

    "abstract": "With the vigorous development of bone/cartilage tissue engineering research, the construction system for in vitro preparation of tissue engineered osteochondral repair substitutes is undergoing a transformation from static culture mode to 3D dynamic culture mode. However, for dynamic culture mode, many problems such as the selection of cultivation environment and the optimization of condition parameters need to be solved. In this study, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to simulate and predict the stress conditions of adipose derived stem cells-chitosan7/gelatin3/Nano-hydroxyapatite (ADSCs-Cs7/Gel3/nHAP) structures and ADSCs-bone-derived scaffold structures, as well as the flow field distribution in spinner flask (SF) at different rotational speeds. Finally, the appropriate operating conditions of SF were optimized. The simulation results showed that SF generated two fluid cycles bounded by the bottom edge of the stirring paddle in the entire fluid flow region, with a fluid circulation region exhibiting a relatively static flow field distribution (compared with the first two cycles) directly below the stirring axis. There was a moderate dynamic pressure and speed under the stirring paddle, making this area the most suitable for fixing the cell-scaffold constructs. Under different rotational speed conditions, the dynamic pressure and fluid shear force of the constructs in SF were positively correlated with the speed. Overall, considering all factors, 50 rpm and 70 rpm were determined as the preferred rotational speed conditions for the ADSCs-Cs7/Gel3/nHAP constructs and ADSCs-derived-bone scaffold constructs in SF, respectively. Subsequently, the cell-scaffold complex cultured under SF was implanted at the site of osteochondral defect in New Zealand rabbits, and it was found that new tissues were formed after 4 weeks of culture. These results indicate that SF cultured scaffolds are suitable for repairing rabbit osteochondral defects.",

    "title": "Novel polygalacturonase PG-BG31 prevents biofilm formation and increases antibiotic efficacy against catheter-associated Escherichia coli",
    "abstract": "Escherichia coli is a leading cause of urinary tract infections, which are particularly problematic in catheterized patients due to the formation of biofilms that are resistant to standard treatments. Here we investigated a novel polygalacturonase (PG-BG31) from Pedobacter sp. BG31 and its anti-biofilm properties against E. coli isolates originating from the urine of UTI patients. The enzyme was heterologously expressed and biochemically characterized using polygalacturonic acid as substrate. The enzyme showed strong biofilm inhibition with BIC50 values between 2 and 5 µg/mL, which varied depending on the E. coli strain. It outperformed enzymes commonly used in E. coli biofilm studies, including proteinase K, DNase and cellulase. When used as a pretreatment, it significantly improved the efficacy of ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim by reducing biofilm formation by 4 log (99.99 %) at lower antibiotic concentrations. Polygalacturonase PG-BG31 works optimally at temperatures of 25 °C - 42 °C and a slightly acidic pH value (pH 5.0 – 6.0), which corresponds to the environment in urine. In addition, the enzyme showed no toxicity to cells in culture or C. elegans. These results suggest that polygalacturonase has the potential for the development of anti-biofilm strategies for catheter-related urinary tract infections.",

    "title": "Application of a novel virus-like particle platform to the development of Neisseria vaccines",
    "abstract": "Development of vaccines against meningococcal meningitis has been driven by the identification of protective protein antigens. In the case of gonorrhoea, this has been less successful, although there is evidence that a vaccine against the causative agent of meningococcal meningitis, Neisseria meningitidis, elicits some protection against infection by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which causes gonorrhoea. Here we describe an approach that uses antigen fusion to antibody Fc domains and attachment to an engineered virus-like particle (VLP) platform to display multiple Neisseria antigens. Any combination of antigens which are fused to an antibody Fc domain can be attached to the VLP, a technology we have termed ‘AbBind’. We exemplify this invention with seven antigens which are vaccine candidates for protection against meningococcal or gonococcal infection. Antigens are expressed as Fc fusions in HEK cells, purified using Protein A and then added to the AbBind VLP core. Five antigens induce potent IgG antibody responses in mice, as fusions to Fc and/or in complex with the VLP core. This highly adaptable platform integrates well with mammalian expression pipelines which are commonly used for antibody production and is therefore readily scalable. The results raise the prospect of jointly formulated vaccines to elicit protection against both diseases.",

    "title": "Optimizing sustainable production of high-quality microalgae-derived extracellular vesicles through batch-refeed perfusion cultivation",
    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are lipid-based nanoparticles with strong potential as therapeutic nanocarriers, but their clinical use is limited by production and cost challenges, especially from human cells. Microalgae-derived EVs (i.e., nanoalgosomes) offer a sustainable and scalable alternative. In this study, we optimized nanoalgosome production by implementing batch-refeed systems that simulate perfusion conditions to improve microalgal viability by maintaining nutrient levels and reducing toxic metabolites. Compared to standard batch cultures, the batch-refeed strategy yielded ten-fold fewer particles but achieved 1.4-fold higher total EV protein yield, likely reflecting a reduction in non-EV co-isolates in favor of bona fide EVs. This is supported by the results of EV-associated luminal esterase activity and by the increase in membrane-enclosed EVs — detected by fluorescent nanoparticle tracking analysis — in batch-refeed–derived nanoalgosomes compared to standard batch cultures, which suggests that the batch-refeed strategy enhances their functional integrity, possibly by preserving vesicle membrane stability and reducing non-vesicular co-isolates. Furthermore, the batch-refeed strategy achieved a three-fold increase in space-time yield (STY) over conventional batch systems. Nanoalgosomes retained key functional properties post-harvest. In vitro assays confirmed that nanoalgosomes derived from both cultivation methods exhibited similar cytoprotective effects, reducing oxidative stress-induced damage in normal mammary epithelial 1–7 HB2 cells and in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. These findings support the use of microalgae-based perfusion-inspired systems as a green, cost-effective and scalable strategy for producing high-quality EVs for biomedical applications.",

    "title": "Acid-triggered ultralong hydrogen release from AB-loaded hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles enhances salt tolerance in sweetpotato",
    "abstract": "Soil salinization severely restricts crop growth and productivity worldwide. Hydrogen (H2) has demonstrated considerable potential in enhancing plant stress tolerance. However, its agricultural application is limited by the rapid dissipation of H2 in traditional electrolysis-generated hydrogen-rich water (HRW). In this work, we synthesized a nanoscale H2-releasing material (AB@HMSN) by encapsulating ammonia borane (AB) into hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles (HMSN), achieving ultrahigh AB loading capacity (811 mg·g−1 HMSN) and acid-responsive sustained H2 release behavior in solution. The H2 release duration reached 75 h, significantly exceeding that of conventional HRW. When applied to salt-stressed (150 mM NaCl) sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam) seedlings, 16 mg·L−1 AB@HMSN significantly improved chlorophyll content, with chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and total chlorophyll increasing by 80 %, 100 %, and 88 %, respectively. Photosynthetic performance was markedly enhanced, showing increases of 53 %, 26 %, and 24 % in photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (Gs), and transpiration rate (Tr), respectively. Additionally, AB@HMSN treatment strengthened antioxidant defenses by elevating the activities of key enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT), while reducing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (H2O2 and ·O2-). Mechanistically, AB@HMSN induced endogenous melatonin (MT) production, which activated sodium-proton (Na+/H+) antiporters and plasma membrane proton-pumping ATPase (PM H+-ATPase) activity. This process restored ion homeostasis by facilitating Na+ efflux, K+ influx, and H+ influx, thereby enhancing salt tolerance. These findings not only advance our understanding of hydrogen-mediated stress tolerance but also offer a practical nanomaterial-based strategy for sustainable agriculture in saline environments.",

    "abstract": "In beer production, lager yeasts are subjected to harsh environment in high-gravity brewing (HGB, 24°P or more), thus leading to reduced fermentation performance, increased mortality and formation of off-flavors. This study aimed to improve the vitality, viability and fermentation characteristics of lager yeast during HGB through the accumulation of intracellular proline and to reveal the potential mechanism. A mutant lager yeast Y-100 with significantly increased intracellular proline fluorescence intensity of 37.37 % was obtained by Atmospheric and Room Temperature Plasma (ARTP) mutagenesis. Compared to parental YY, the mutant Y-100 had 13.94 % higher intracellular ATP content, 23.01 % lower ROS accumulation and 77.71 % lower mortality rate at the end of serial batch fermentation for 5 times. Moreover, the time for beer matureness by Y-100 strain was shorted by one day while the real degree of fermentation value was 2.76 % higher using 24°P wort. Through genome resequencing, RT-qPCR analysis and gene knockout and overexpression, the up-regulation of GNP1 and SUA7 genes in Y-100 strain might contribute to the proline accumulation in lager yeast cells, thus resulting in energy supply and stress protection for lager yeast during HGB. The results not only provided new insights into the role of proline in lager yeast towards unfavorable industrial condition, but also obtained a high-efficient Y-100 strain for potential HGB application.",

In this study, composite nanocomplexes incorporating chitosan and proteins derived from barnacle cement and spider silk were designed and biofabricated for enhanced antibacterial properties. The impact of chitosan’s molecular weight on the properties of nanocomplexes comprising cp19k-MaSp1/chitosan, MaSp1/chitosan, and cp19k/chitosan was evaluated. The results revealed that low molecular weight chitosan (LMWC, Mw = 1 kDa) forms nanocomplexes that exhibit distinct structural differences in comparison to those formed with high molecular weight chitosan (HMWC, Mw ≥ 150 kDa). Furthermore, cp19k-MaSp1/C150k exhibited the most potent antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus, surpassing the performance of cp19k, MaSp1, cp19k-MaSp1, and chitosan individually, achieving inhibition by disrupting the bacterial cell membrane structure and elevating the intracellular ROS level. Meanwhile, On day 6, the viability of HUVECs (Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells) of cp19k-MaSp1/C150k had attained a level of 145.21 ± 6.23 %, representing a substantial elevation when compared to C150k.

    "title": "Substitution of reactive centre loop residues from C1 esterase inhibitor increases the inhibitory specificity of alpha-1 antitrypsin for plasma kallikrein",
    "abstract": "C1 esterase inhibitor (C1INH) is a member of the serpin superfamily of proteins and controls plasma kallikrein (Pka). Purified C1INH concentrates are effective in controlling C1INH deficiency (hereditary angioedema, HAE). Because C1INH is a relatively slow inhibitor of Pka, we sought to develop a more effective inhibitor by exchanging reactive centre loop (RCL) residues in another serpin, alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) variant M358R, with the corresponding residues of C1INH. Novel, soluble, N-terminally hexahistidine-tagged variants were expressed in E. coli, purified by nickel chelate chromatography, and characterized kinetically. AAT/C1INH loop exchange mutants were designated by the RCL residues exchanged using the reactive centre P1-P1′ convention. Maximal exchange mutant AC (10–4′) inhibited Pka 78-fold and activated Factor XI (FXIa) 350-fold less rapidly than AAT M358R. Eleven additional variants were expressed, restoring AAT residues stepwise. The most selective variant was AC (10–3/4′), which restored AAT residues from P2-P3′ compared to AC (10–4′), and inhibited Pka 1.9-fold more rapidly, and FXIa 1.6-fold less rapidly, for a gain in selectivity of 2.8-fold (p < 0.0001), without increasing the stoichiometry of inhibition (SI). The most active variant was AC (10−3), in which both the rate of Pka and FXIa inhibition were elevated relative to AAT M358R values, without SI elevation. Other variants exhibited slower reaction rates and/or elevated SI values. These results indicate that RCL exchanges can be productively employed to change serpin specificity and selectivity, but that the most effective exchanges may not be contiguous due to cooperativity between RCL residues.",

    "abstract": "Prenylnaringenin (PN) compounds, namely 8-prenylnaringenin (8-PN), 3’-prenylnaringenin (3’-PN), and 6-prenylnaringenin (6-PN), are reported to have several interesting bioactivities. This study aimed to validate a biosynthetic pathway for de novo production of PN in Escherichia coli. A previously optimized E. coli chassis capable of efficiently de novo producing naringenin was used to evaluate eleven prenyltransferases (PTs) for the production of PN compounds. As PT reaction requires dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) as extended substrate that has limited availability inside the cells, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated protein 12a (Cas12a) (CRISPR-Cas12a) was used to construct ten boosted DMAPP-E. coli strains. All the PTs, in combination with the naringenin biosynthetic pathway, were tested in these strains. Experiments in 96-well deep well plates identified twelve strains capable of producing PN. E. coli M-PAR-121 with the integration of the 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS) gene from E. coli (EcDXS) into the lacZ locus of the genome (E. coli M-PAR-121:EcDXS) expressing the soluble aromatic PT from Streptomyces roseochromogenes (CloQ) and the naringenin biosynthetic pathway was selected as the best producer strain. After optimizing the production media in shake flasks, 160.57 µM of 3’-PN, 4.4 µM of 6-PN, and 2.66 µM of 8-PN were obtained. The production was then evaluated at the bioreactor scale and 397.57 µM of 3’-PN (135.33 mg/L) and 25.61 µM of 6-PN (8.72 mg/L) were obtained.

    "abstract": "N4-bis(aminopropyl)spermidine (BCPA), a branched-chain polyamine, is uniquely found in hyperthermophiles that thrive above 80°C. Compared to linear polyamines such as spermidine and spermine, BCPA induces DNA compaction at significantly lower concentrations and precipitates DNA more efficiently. To harness these properties, BCPA was immobilized onto N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-activated magnetic microbeads, and its DNA recovery efficiency was evaluated using Salmon sperm DNA. BCPA-conjugated beads exhibited superior DNA-binding capacity compared to spermidine-conjugated and conventional silica beads, with bound DNA remaining unreleased upon treatment with 0.5 % sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 2 mM ATP, or 2 mM phosphate (Pi) at pH 8.8. However, efficient DNA release was achieved with 2 mM pyrophosphate (PPi) at pH 8.0 or 1 mM PPi at pH 10.3. This property enables direct DNA amplification without a separate release step, as dNTPs used in PCR generate PPi as a byproduct, facilitating DNA detachment. To assess the beads' applicability for low-copy DNA detection, plasmid DNA containing the Ureaplasma parvum 16S rRNA region was prepared in saline at varying concentrations. BCPA-conjugated beads successfully recovered and directly amplified as few as 10³ copies of plasmid DNA from a 10-mL saline solution, whereas the same amount remained undetectable using conventional magnetic beads ethanol precipitation. These findings demonstrate the potential of BCPA-conjugated beads for efficient DNA capture and direct amplification, with promising applications in clinical diagnostics and environmental DNA monitoring.",

Current chemical synthesis methods are environmentally harmful, and whole-cell catalysis processes are costly due to expensive substrates. Direct fermentative production of KIV and KIC from glucose is a promising alternative, although research in this area remains limited. In this study, we engineered an L-valine-overproducing Corynebacterium glutamicum strain for KIV and KIC production. We inactivated leucine dehydrogenase and isopropylmalate synthase to block the formation of L-valine and KIC, resulting in the production of 53.5 g/L KIV with a yield of 0.16 g/g glucose and a productivity of 0.70 g/L·h⁻¹ in a 5-L fermentor. Next, we overexpressed genes in the L-leucine biosynthesis pathway (leuA, leuCD, and leuB) by introducing a feedback-resistant leuA (leuAfbr) in a plasmid-based system, deleting the transcriptional repressor gene ltbR, and increasing the gene copy numbers of leuCD and leuB under a strong promoter, creating a high-KIC-producing strain. Acetate supplementation enhanced acetyl-CoA supply, increasing KIC production while reducing KIV accumulation. The final strain produced 79.8 g/L KIC with a yield of 0.29 g/g glucose and a productivity of 1.05 g/L·h⁻¹ in a 5-L fermentor, surpassing previous fermentation results and most whole-cell catalysis processes, highlighting its industrial application potential.",

The yield of production was 0.01 mg of the inhibitor in 1 mL of reaction in 15 minutes at 28°C using the purified enzyme. Moreover, biological assays demonstrated that the resulting compound has a novel and stronger antioxidant and antimicrobial activities, respectively, when compared to piperine. The data further demonstrates the broader potential of engineered enzymes as versatile and sustainable tools in industrial biotechnology, offering an efficient platform for the modification of natural compounds to produce bioactive molecules.",

    "abstract": "Researchers often apply physical, chemical, or biological stresses to cyanobacteria cultivation to enhance biomass production by triggering cellular adaptation mechanisms, increasing growth or boosting target compound synthesis. Static magnetic fields (SMF) offer a non-toxic, cost-effective way to modulate microalgal growth, alter biomass composition, and promote metabolite production. Polymeric nanofibers (Nano) function as a physical barrier in cultivation, while monoethanolamine (MEA) acts as a chemical absorbent, reducing CO₂ loss and enhancing biofixation. This study investigated the effects of SMF and nanofibers on the biomass yield and molecular composition of Limnospira indica PCC 8005. The combined SMF and Nano treatment achieved the highest biomass yield (5.87 ± 0.06 g L⁻¹), a 28 % increase compared to the control. SMF application increased protein content by 16 % but reduced carbohydrate levels by 73 % relative to the nanofiber-only treatment (39.58 ± 0.98 % ww⁻¹). Exopolysaccharide (EPS) produced under the SMF+NanoMEA treatment contained 39.9 % uronic acid, while the Nano-only treatment had the highest sulphate content (8.4 %) but the lowest uronic acid concentration (25.4 %). The EPS were identified as acidic, sulphated polysaccharides. SMF and nanofibers significantly enhances biomass production, alters the carbohydrate and protein proportions in biomass, and influences the composition of sugars, acids, and sulphate in exopolysaccharides.",

Our study demonstrated that flocculation using a combination of chitosan and NaOH was an effective method for harvesting green-vegetative H. pluvialis, which surpasses centrifugation in both biomass and astaxanthin production. A tri-layer tray bioreactor was developed to enhance astaxanthin production via biofilm redistribution by using a rinsing method, and its effectiveness was further supported by a tray photobioreactor with an integrated automatic rinsing system. The biofilm method achieved an optimal specific light energy consumption for astaxanthin production of 9.42 kWh g−1 at the light intensity of 150 μmol m−2 s−1, presenting its potential for commercial-scale cultivation of H. pluvialis for astaxanthin production.",

    "abstract": "L-Norvaline is a crucial intermediate in the synthesis of antihypertensive agents, and its production via biotechnological methods has garnered significant interest and commercial value in recent years. Here, for the enzymatic cascade synthesis of L-norvaline from propionaldehyde and glycine, an L-phenylserine aldolase gene (designated as ppLPA) from Pseudomonas putida was selected. Following the identification of potential mutation sites via error-prone PCR, coupled with site-directed mutagenesis, a single-site mutant, I18T, was identified, exhibiting a 1.4-fold increase in enzyme activity. Then, the ppLPA mutant I18T was combined with L-threonine deaminase, L-leucine dehydrogenase, and alcohol dehydrogenase to construct a one-pot, multi-enzyme cascade catalytic system for L-norvaline synthesis. The reaction conditions were systematically optimized. To mitigate the inhibitory effects of propionaldehyde, we employed a pH-stat substrate feeding strategy. Under optimal reaction conditions, L-norvaline production achieved a maximum yield of 116.5 g/L after 14 h of reaction, with a conversion rate exceeding 99 % in a 1 L reaction volume.

    "abstract": "Sucrose synthase (SuSy) is a unique glycosyltransferase that can be utilized in the production of nucleoside monosaccharides, such as diphosphate (UDP)-glucose, which serve as essential sugar donors for the glycosylation reactions catalyzed by UDP-dependent glycosyltransferases (UGTs). The selection of an appropriate SuSy coupled with a UGT is crucial for achieving the efficient synthesis of glycoside products. In this study, three candidate SuSy genes were identified from the transcriptome sequencing of Stevia rebaudiana, among which SrSUS1 was found to be expressed and active in Escherichia coli. The optimal temperature and pH for SrSUS1 were determined to be 55°C and pH 7.0, respectively.

    "abstract": "Bacillus velezensis 83 (Bv83) spores are the active ingredient in Fungifree AB, an agricultural biocontrol agent whose industrial production is negatively affected by poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA) biopolymer synthesis at pH 6.8. At pH 5, γ-PGA production and sporulation are suppressed, but the latter is restored through pH-shift to 6.8 after glucose depletion. This work presents a comprehensive Bv83 spore bioprocess development through physiological and transcriptional analyses. At pH 5, Bv83 present a strategic response to pH stress by reducing its growth rate and redirecting energy towards survival rather than differentiation (downregulating lipopeptide and γ-PGA production genes) and maintaining SigB-mediated stress response rather than sporulation. Transcriptome analysis revealed downregulation of comX and phrC genes at pH 5, indicating sporulation limitation from insufficient signaling molecule production. Indeed, our results confirmed the essential role of the competence and sporulation factor (CSF) in differentiation of elongated cells into forespores. Furthermore, spent medium addition from high-cell-density cultures induced complete sporulation at pH 5, suggesting critical metabolite concentrations (besides CSF) are required. A pH-shift strategy during fed-batch cultivation suppressed γ-PGA synthesis, leading to enhanced mixing and oxygen transfer. Moreover, this strategy led to a 2.6-fold increase in spore productivity (7.86 ×1010 spores L−1 h−1) compared to a batch at pH 6.8, reducing operational costs. This research has identified pH-regulated metabolic networks, establishing a foundation for designing efficient, cost-effective industrial-scale B. velezensis fermentation strategies that comply with regulatory requirements for biocontrol applications.",

    "abstract": "Gibberellic acid (GA3) is a critical plant hormone with significant agricultural applications, yet its production in Fusarium fujikuroi is constrained by competition for metabolic precursors, particularly acetyl-CoA, which is essential for GA3 biosynthesis. The genome of F. fujikuroi harbors numerous secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters that divert acetyl-CoA away from the GA3 pathway, thereby limiting its yield. To address this challenge, we employed the CRISPR/Cas9 system to delete the bikaverin and fusarubin biosynthesis gene clusters, which are known to compete with GA3 biosynthesis for acetyl-CoA. This genetic intervention resulted in a substantial increase in GA3 production, with the ΔBIKΔFSR strain yielding 31.67 % more GA3 compared to the wild-type strain. Notably, the deletion of these gene clusters not only enhanced GA3 biosynthesis but also improved mycelial growth and carbon assimilation, as evidenced by increased consumption of reducing sugars during fermentation. We further employed qRT-PCR to assess comparative expression levels of genes associated with the glycohydrolysis, glycolysis, and the TCA pathway in engineered strain. Results indicated that removing by-product gene clusters enhances the glycohydrolase system, accelerating carbon assimilation. Given the presence of dozens of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters in the F. fujikuroi genome, the strategy reported here offers a promising avenue for further enhancing GA3 production by targeting additional non-essential gene clusters.",

This gene cluster supports inducible heterogeneous ectoine synthesis controlled by the T7 promoter in the recombinant halophile host Vibrio natriegens Vmax × 2. Investigation of the dosage effect of each gene in the cluster on ectoine synthesis identified ectC as the most important gene. We performed in silico directed evolution and Pythia analysis to design ectC mutants and screen those that positively contribute to ectoine synthesis. We used a sequence-generating tool to design degenerated EctC coding sequences to ensure EctC levels in recombinant V. natriegens. Ectoine synthesis was validated in a 5-L stirring fermenter. A titer of 56.47 g/L ectoine was achieved in 28 h through feed batch fermentation.

Although quantifying 2′-FL is crucial for its economical production and nutritional management, conventional methods require expensive equipment and skilled personnel, making high-throughput quantification challenging. In this study, we present a simple and cost-effective method for 2′-FL quantification by utilizing the thermal stability of BoGT6a, a glycosyltransferase derived from Bacteroides ovatus that specifically binds to 2′-FL. Initially, the binding of BoGT6a and 2′-FL was confirmed, and we demonstrated that 2′-FL-bound BoGT6a is protected from thermal stress. To achieve rapid detection of 2′-FL, we fused BoGT6a with the fluorescent protein mCherry, resulting in mCherry-BoGT6a, and investigated its thermal stability and fluorescence in response to varying 2′-FL concentrations. Finally, we developed a 2′-FL quantification device that measures protein precipitation with the change of electrical voltage.

Presence of protein encoded by PAS_chr4_0626 was considered as the key part of PAOX1 repression in glycerol according to sequence analysis by JASPAR.

    "abstract": "By performing a biological network analysis, we identified some hub genes, which were up- or down-regulated in the breast cancer (BC) cell line after treatment with IFN-γ. Moreover, several pathways including cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, TNF signaling pathway, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, and NF-κB signaling pathway were detected that their activation leads to the antiproliferation, proapoptosis, and antiviral activities. To validate in silico results, the bioactivity of recombinant human IFN-γ (hIFN-γ) produced in different hosts was analyzed by antiviral and anticancer assays. The antiviral role of the hIFN-γ preparations was evaluated by inhibition of Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV)-mediated cytopathic effects on Vero cells. A dose-dependent increase in cell viability was observed at different concentrations of recombinant proteins. The maximum amount of the cell viability detected for the hIFN-γ preparations was determined at a concentration of 32.00 pg/mL. To analyze the cytotoxic efficacy of the hIFN-γ preparations on the growth and development of tumor cells, a BC cell line (MCF-7) was treated with both recombinant protein forms in a time- and dose-dependent way. The highest level of inhibiting cell proliferation was detected at a concentration of 32.00 pg/mL hIFN-γ after 72 h incubation. Anticancer and antiviral functions of IFN-γ were confirmed via the expression analysis of hub genes cd74, cxcl10, il6, and stat1 using RT-PCR. Furthermore, the hIFN-γ preparations were significantly able to up-regulate the expression of proapoptotic Bax and p53 and to down-regulate Bcl-2 as an antiapoptotic gene, showing the cytotoxic effect of hIFN-γ toward MCF-7 cells via apoptosis induction.",

The patient's chances of recovery and survival can be improved by early detection. The existing methods for detecting brain tumour have several limitations, including limited accessibility, exposure to radiation, high costs and potential for false negatives. To overcome the issues, a Deep Maxout-Visual Geometry Group-16 (DM-VGG-16) model is devised for detecting tumour in brain from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Initially, MRI image is sent for pre-processing as input. Here, Non-Local Mean (NLM) filter performs pre-processing. The pre-processed image is subjected to segmentation stage, which is accomplished by Template–based K-means and improved Fuzzy C Means algorithm (TKFCM). Moreover, in feature extraction stage, various features, like area, cluster prominence, Hybrid PCA- Normalized GIST (NGIST) and Improved Median binary Pattern (IMBP) are extracted. Lastly, proposed DM-VGG-16 model is utilized for detection of brain tumors from extracted features. The DM-VGG-16 is the integration of Deep Maxout Network (DMN) and Visual Geometry Group-16 (VGG-16).

    "title": "Brazilian Amazon red propolis as a sustainable resource for the green synthesis of antibacterial silver nanoparticles",
    "abstract": "This study investigates the use of Amazon red propolis for the green synthesis of antibacterial silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). A hydroalcoholic propolis extract was fractionated to yield fractions rich in phenolic compounds. High-performance liquid chromatography identified calycosin as a chemical marker, along with liquiritigenin, isoliquiritigenin, and formononetin. The propolis extract and the chloroform fraction inhibited Staphylococcus aureus growth with a bactericidal effect, while for Escherichia coli, a bacteriostatic effect was observed at concentrations below 1000 µg/mL. The AgNPs were characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, confirming surface plasmon resonance, and their morphology and size were analyzed using dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy, with elemental composition assessed via energy-dispersive spectroscopy. X-ray diffraction and selected area electron diffraction showed the crystalline structure. Fourier-transform infrared spectra indicated that carboxyl and hydroxyl groups in flavonoids reduce silver ions and contribute to the nanoparticles' chemical stability. The nanoparticles synthesized from the propolis extract showed enhanced antibacterial potential, with efficacy against E. coli (MIC 25 µg/mL, MBC 50 µg/mL) compared to S. aureus (MIC 100 µg/mL, MBC 100 µg/mL), and demonstrated selectivity for Gram-negative bacteria over murine macrophages (CC50 83.92 μg/mL). These nanoparticles exhibited maximum absorption in the UV-Vis region at 418 nm, with a spherical silver core encapsulated by compounds from propolis, hydrodynamic diameter of 252.47 ± 1.42 nm, a zeta potential of −51.80 ± 0.70 mV, and a polydispersity index of 0.218 ± 0.01, indicating high chemical stability.

This study introduced a novel three-dimensional (3D) culture system utilizing Magnolia leaf vein scaffolds, characterized for their biocompatibility and evaluated for their impact on Muse cells' proliferation, adhesion, osteogenic differentiation, and exosome secretion. The isolation of Muse cells from Periodontal Ligament Stem Cells (PDLSCs) was successfully accomplished, with excellent compatibility observed with the plant-derived scaffolds. Notably, the 3D culture substantially upregulated osteogenic markers and promoted the formation of mineralized nodules, signifying enhanced osteogenic potential. Additionally, Muse cells in 3D culture exhibited a significant increase in exosome secretion, which were more effective in stimulating PDLSCs proliferation. The study concluded that plant leaf vein scaffolds provide a sustainable and effective platform for 3D stem cell culture, with the potential to significantly enhance the therapeutic efficacy of Muse cells in periodontal tissue engineering.",

    "abstract": "Diamine oxidase (DAO-1) from Yarrowia lipolytica was recombinantly produced in Komagataella phaffii in fed-batch bioreactor cultivations using the constitutive GAP and methanol-inducible AOX1 promoters. Utilizing an exponential glucose feed, a maximum DAO-1 activity of 43 ± 7 µkat/Lculture was achieved after 37 h of cultivation using the GAP promoter. When the AOX1 promoter was used, a maximum DAO-1 activity of 230 ± 13 µkat/Lculture was achieved after 90 h of cultivation with a stepwise increase in the methanol feed. Thus, approximately 15- (GAP promoter) and 82-fold (AOX1 promoter) higher DAO-1 activities were obtained in K. phaffii compared to homologous recombinant production in Y. lipolytica. The DAO-1 produced in K. phaffii has been partially purified and was formulated as a sucrose-based tablet containing 4500 nkat DAO-1 activity. The DAO-1 tablet was tested for histamine degradation in a simulated intestinal fluid in the presence of food components, and approximately 90 % of the histamine applied initially (75 mg) was degraded in 90 minutes. This is the first time that a DAO-1 tablet has been able to break down such large amounts of histamine under simulated intestinal fluid conditions, which could help people with histamine intolerance in the future.",

    "abstract": "Here, astaxanthin production in Escherichia coli was systematically improved step by step. By introducing the additional copy of CrtZ and fusion complex of CrtZ and CrtW, astaxanthin content in cells increased from 0.10 mg/g to 0.16 mg/g and 0.63 mg/g DCW, respectively. Remolding the astaxanthin gene cluster by replacing the PanCrtE by HpGGPPS3–1 and the fusion of CrtZ and CrtW increased astaxanthin content to 1.98 mg/g DCW. Further selecting the productive host and optimizing culture conditions dramatically increased astaxanthin content to 3.61 mg/g DCW. Subsequently, the fed-batch fermentation achieved the maximum yield of astaxanthin at 509.58 mg/L with the productivity of 7.72 mg/L/h and 5.91 mg/g DCW, covering 98.17 % of detected carotenoids. The chirality analysis assigned the same isomer of astaxanthin extracted from our fermentation system and Haematococcus pluvialis. Moreover, the radical and superoxide anion scavenging activity analysis revealed that astaxanthin achieved in this study performed better than natural astaxanthin extracted from H. pluvialis and chemical synthetic astaxanthin.

    "abstract": "Upcycling potential of side-streams and waste material, originating from a shopping center were studied as a feedstock for plant cell cultures of arctic bramble (Rubus arcticus L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and tobacco BY-2 (Nicotiana tabacum L.). Soft drink waste mix, orange peels, expired bread, spent coffee grounds, and brewer’s spent grain, were used in cultivation experiments to supplement sucrose in the basic growth medium. Artificial urine was included to represent a future scenario, where also human urine could be used as a circular feedstock along improvement in purification technologies allowing removal of microbes and toxic molecules. Diluted artificial urine was used to replace elemental macronutrients e.g., ammonium, phosphate, and sulphate in the culture medium. Soft drink waste mix and artificial urine contributed to the highest biomass accumulation of the tested side streams. Culture medium composition optimization, exploiting combination of soft drink waste mix and artificial urine, was conducted with design of experiments software. The optimized culture medium contributed to notable culture medium cost reductions of 55 %, 33 % and 45 % for arctic bramble, tobacco BY-2 and barley cell lines, respectively, without compromising the biomass yield. However, modified culture medium induced some changes in the amino acid composition of arctic bramble plant cell biomass, e.g., increased asparagine and decreased arginine, alanine and tyrosine contents. Thus, attention should be paid to the amino acid composition in further studies. Our findings confirm the potential of upcycling side streams and replacing costly growth medium components with so far unutilized resources.",

    "abstract": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae sake strains exhibit high alcoholic fermentation performance. Comparative transcriptomic analysis revealed that the expression of genes required for nitrogen sensing and metabolism, including amino acid biosynthesis and uptake, was markedly lower in the sake strain than in the laboratory strain. Thus, we hypothesized that changes in nitrogen metabolism affect the fermentation capability of S. cerevisiae. To evaluate the impact of altered nitrogen metabolism on alcoholic fermentation, we focused on the transcription activators Gcn4p, Gln3p, and Gat1p, and the protein kinase Npr1p, all of which are key regulators controlling expression of genes for amino acid biosynthesis and uptake responding to nitrogen availability. Fermentation tests demonstrated that laboratory strain-derived single-deletion mutants of the regulator genes exhibited higher fermentation performance than the parental strain, which was accompanied by decrease in intracellular amino acid levels in the mutants. Disruption of the genes encoding glutamate dehydrogenases, which play a central role in nitrogen assimilation, also enhanced the fermentation rate. A Greatwall family protein kinase Rim15p inhibits alcoholic fermentation by diverting carbon flux from glycolysis to the synthesis of 1,3-β-glucan, a major cell wall component. Since the content of 1,3-β-glucan was unaffected by disruption of the regulator genes, the elevated fermentation performance of the disruptants was accomplished independently of the signaling pathway governed by Rim15p. The high fermentation rate of the disruptants might be attributed to increased carbon entry into glycolysis caused by the compromised biosynthesis of amino acids, which are synthesized from intermediary metabolites of glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle.",

    "abstract": "Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is a severe disease that leads to female infertility. Previous studies have suggested that genetic mutations are one of the causes of POI. In order to explore novel pathogenic genes associated with POI, we performed whole-exome sequencing on 111 patients with POI. A rare stop codon variant (NM_002701: c.876 T > G: p.Y292*) of the POU5F1 gene was identified in one patient. The POU5F1 gene encodes the OCT4 protein, which has been reported to play an essential role in the specification and proliferation of primordial germ cells. In this study, we constructed wild-type (WT) and truncated mutant plasmids of the POU5F1 gene, transfected cells with them respectively, and carried out RNA sequencing analysis. We found that 681 genes were differentially expressed between the groups expressing the POU5F1-WT and truncated mutant plasmids. Gene ontology analysis revealed that these genes were enriched in biological processes such as germ cell development, gonadal development, follicle-regulated growth to maturity, ovulation from ovarian follicle, and negative regulation of the BMP signaling pathway. Quantitative real-time PCR confirmed that the genes LIN28A, NANOG, TRIM49D1, FRG2C, KLHL10, and HOXB4 were significantly differentially expressed between the groups expressing the POU5F1-WT and truncated mutant plasmids. This study is the first to discover that the POU5F1 gene may be associated with POI, and suggests that the rare truncated mutation of the POU5F1 gene may be one of the genetic pathogenic factors of POI.",

The results revealed that the hfq gene mutation did not alter the bacterial growth rate or morphology. However, the Δhfq mutant exhibited significantly reduced survival under stress conditions, including 42 °C heat shock, 100 mM H2O2, 8 mM HCl, and iron-deficient environments, compared with the parent strain. Moreover, the mutation led to attenuated bacterial virulence in the mouse infection model. RNA-seq results revealed that the different expressed genes are involved in the stress response, iron ion metabolism, and transcriptional regulation, and some potential virulence factors, such as sodA and rpoC in Glaesserella parasuis were downregulated. Overall, these findings provide preliminary insights into the molecular mechanism between Hfq protein, stress response, and bacterial virulence.",

    "abstract": "Bali cattle, domesticated from wild banteng (Bos javanicus), serve as an important indigenous genetic resource in Indonesia. Creating a detailed mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) sequence of Bali cattle is essential for population genetic research and promoting sustainable breeding. This study aimed to assemble the complete mitogenome sequence of Bali cattle, analyze its genetic features, and explore its phylogenetic position within the Bos genus. High-molecular-weight genomic DNA was extracted from the blood of a male Bali cattle, and mitogenome sequencing was performed using Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing, combining nanopore adaptive sampling (NAS) and amplicon-based sequencing approaches. Both NAS and amplicon-based methods can assemble a complete mitogenome of Bali cattle. However, validating NAS assemblies through amplicon-based sequencing improves accuracy and completeness. The complete mitogenome of Bali cattle spans 16,387 bp, comprising 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, two ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, and a non-coding control region (CR), which showed a structure similar to that observed in other Bos species. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Bali cattle group with B. javanicus, closely related to Javan banteng (B. j. javanicus). Interestingly, a unique tandem repeat sequence was found only in the CR of B. j. javanicus, including Bali cattle. Notably, the current NCBI reference mitogenome for B. javanicus (NC_012706.1) is more closely related to B. taurus than to verified B. javanicus sequences, underscoring the need for a reliable B. javanicus-specific reference mitogenome. This study offers novel insights into the comprehensive mitogenomic architecture of Bali cattle. Furthermore, the discovery of a unique tandem repeat motif offers potential as a marker for Bali cattle identification and its applications in forensic and product authentication.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial function plays a crucial role in understanding the pathogenesis of acute myocardial infarction.This study investigates mitochondrial function-related genes (MFRGs) in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) through bioinformatics and rigorous experimental validation. Using three integrated GEO datasets (149 samples: 80 AMI, 69 control), we applied machine learning methods (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), phenotype scoring, consensus clustering, and weighted gene co-expression network analysis in three subgrouping stages to refine the selection of MFRGs. The intersection of three subgroup analyses results identified 11 key Mitochondrial function-Related Differentially Expressed Genes (MRDEGs). Gene Ontology / Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis (GOKEGG), Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA), and immune infiltration analyses revealed significant pathways and suggested alterations in the composition of immune cell subpopulations. Single-cell analysis revealed increased expression of MRDEGs (NDUFA8, ECI2, and ACADM) in cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and macrophages, along with dynamic expression trends along the pseudotime trajectory. Subgroup analysis of cardiomyocytes based on mitochondrial gene scoring was performed to explore functional enrichment characteristics. Furthermore, we robustly validated these genes’ expression in the cardiomyocyte hypoxia/reoxygenation model and the mouse model of myocardial infarction using flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot. Finally, this study constructed the mRNA regulatory network of key MRDEGs and preliminarily explored the potential therapeutic value of valproic acid and acetaminophen through molecular docking.These findings reveal the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the mechanisms of AMI and its associated cell subpopulations, along with the involved biological pathways, offering new insights for AMI research.",

    "abstract": "In our previous studies, we observed increased plasma levels of S100 calcium-binding protein A6 (S100A6) in patients with non–small-cell lung cancer. In Calu-6 lung cancer cells, S100A6 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting growth and enhancing apoptosis, with no significant effect on cell differentiation. In the present study, we used lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cell lines to confirm the function of S100A6 in this subtype of lung cancer. We selected the LUAD cell line H1975 with high S100A6 expression and PC9 with low S100A6 expression, further constructing H1975 cells transfected with siRNA (H1975/SiRNA) and PC9 cells transfected with overexpressed S100A6 plasmid (PC9/S100A6). Control groups included blank cells and empty vector-transfected cells (named as H1975/neo and PC9/neo respectively). Cell Counting Kit-8, wound-healing, transwell assays, flow cytometric analysis, and nude mouse tumorigenicity were used to detect the biological activities of cells, including proliferation, migration, invasiveness, apoptosis, cell cycle, and tumorigenicity. By comparing cell behavior among the three groups in the two cell lines (H1975, H1975/neo, and H1975/SiRNA; PC9, PC9/neo, and PC9/S100A6), we found an association between S100A6 overexpression and enhanced cell proliferation, migration, invasion, tumorigenicity, and decreased apoptosis. Therefore, S100A6 promotes carcinogenesis in LUAD cells. Our results, from two aspects, indicate that S100A6 has an upbeat influence on the biological characteristics of LUAD cell lines, playing an important role in tumorigenesis and progression of LUAD.",

    "abstract": "Zeugodacus tau is a major quarantine insect pest that causes considerable damage to vegetable industries in Jiangxi area. Symbiotic microbes play essential roles in the long-term coevolution of host insects. While symbiotic bacteria are increasingly recognized as pivotal mediators of insect physiology and ecology, characterization of bacteria dynamics across life cycles of Z. tau remains limited. To address this knowledge gap, we surveyed the dynamic changes of symbiotic microbiota across various life stages of Z. tau, including larva, pupa, female and male adult, using high-throughput sequencing technology on the Illumina MiSeq platform. A total of 2,574 Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) were discerned from 16S rRNA genes. Alpha diversity analysis disclosed the pupa of Z. tau possessed the highest bacterial abundance and diversity. Notably, Pseudomonadota was the dominant phylum across all stages except the larva, where Lactiplantibacillus predominated. Klebsiella and Enterobacter were the main genera in adult males and females. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis demonstrated stage-specific functional specialization, with larvae preferentially activating carbohydrate metabolism for growth while adults upregulated energy metabolism to support flight and reproduction. These findings provide foundational insights into host-microbiota interactions and may inform the development of microbiota-targeted pest management strategies.",

    "abstract": "The Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas is well-known for its exceptionally high taurine content, but the mechanisms underlying taurine biosynthesis remain largely unexplored. The cysteamine (AET) pathway is one of the primary metabolic routes involved in taurine biosynthesis, and its role in mollusk taurine synthesis has garnered increasing recognition. In the present study, a cysteamine dioxygenase (ADO) homolog CgADO, the central enzyme of the AET pathway, was identified in C. gigas, which contained a typical PCO_ADO domain. The transcripts of CgADO were constitutively expressed in examined oyster tissues, with the highest level detected in the adductor muscle while the lowest in the hepatopancreas. The recombinant CgADO protein, expressed in Escherichia coli, was capable of converting cysteamine to hypotaurine. Overexpression of CgADO in HEK293T cells increased the production of taurine by 20.31-fold, compared to cells transfected with the empty vector. Inhibition of endogenous CgADO expression using RNA interference resulted in a 49% reduction in its mRNA expression and an 8% decline in taurine content in the adductor muscle of oysters. These results indicated that CgADO functioned as a cysteamine dioxygenase and played a certain role in taurine biosynthesis in C. gigas.",

This study provides the first comprehensive transcriptomic and epigenomic map of minipigs, analyzing five tissues (back fat, heart, kidney, liver, and loin) from groups at the ends of a continuum in body size variation. This foundational epigenomic dataset identified tissue-specific genes, revealing key mechanisms underlying physiological and pathological processes such as MYH7B in the heart and ITIH4 in the liver. Genes with differential epigenomic signatures according to the body size variation within minipigs included DES in the heart, which is involved in myofibril linkage and filament formation. Notably, human DNA methylation features in immune-associated genes such as IFI30, NCK2, NFKB1, and SOS2 exhibited stronger epigenomic conservation with minipigs than standard pigs, emphasizing their potential as a closer model for human immune responses. In conclusion, this high-resolution dataset provides a valuable foundation for advancing research in xenotransplantation, organ development, and immune mechanisms, positioning minipigs as a robust model for biomedical applications.",

    "abstract": "The cyp19a1 gene is a ubiquitous sex-related gene that encodes aromatase, which catalyzes the conversion of androgen to estrogen. Expression of the cyp19a1 gene is closely tied to female sex differentiation. Therefore, we studied sexual expression differences and the transcriptional regulatory mechanism in a fish that is easily sex-reversible, the Chinese tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis). The results showed that cyp19a1 was expressed in the gonads of males, pseudomales, and females, specifically in the seminiferous lobule cavity and sertoli cells of the testis, as well as within oocytes of the ovary. The results of dual-luciferase reporter assay in HEK293T cells and overexpression ftz-f1 experiment in in vitro-cultured Chinese tongue sole ovarian cells revealed that the Ftz-f1 transcription factor regulated the cyp19a1 gene. Furthermore, we concluded that the CTGGCCTTCCT sequence located at −952 position was the transcriptional binding sequence according to fragment deletion and directed base mutation of dual-luciferase reporter assay. In summary, Ftz-f1 transcriptionally regulated the sex-related cyp19a1 gene by binding to the −952 site to affect gonadal development. These results will enhance the precision of female-biased breeding for Chinese tongue sole at the molecular level, providing valuable insights for the aquaculture industry.",

    "abstract": "Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are remnants of ancient viral infections that have integrated into host genomes, significantly influencing genome evolution, adaptation, and disease. This study employed a genome-wide screening protocol to analyze 49 genomes, covering 17 species within the Bovinae subfamily, including 25 cattle genomes and 7 buffalo genomes. The identification of ERVs primarily employed RepeatModeler. To gauge ERV activity, Kimura divergence was applied, and PCR genotyping validated insertion polymorphisms across 12 international breeds, shedding light on the activity of selected potential ERVs. Intersection analyses mapped ERV integration in protein-coding (PC) and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) genes. A total of 22 distinct ERV groups were identified, consisting of 20 beta-retroviruses (Class II) and two gamma-retroviruses (Class I). Notably, the abundance of ERVs varied significantly, with Bubalus bubalis (buffalo) housing 838 ERVs compared to 575 in Bos taurus (cattle). Five ERV groups showed recent activity (Kimura divergence < 5 %), and PCR genotyping revealed breed-specific polymorphisms in both cattle and buffalo, suggesting ongoing retroviral influence. Buffalo genomes demonstrated 33 % more ERV integrations than cattle, with ERVs enriched in PC (23.62–33.44 %) and lncRNA genes (24.34–30.76 %). Phylogenetic analysis traced the origins of these ERVs to approximately 15.89 million years ago, coinciding with the diversification of the Bovinae subfamily. While ERVs were depleted in transcribed regions likely due to purifying selection, they were enriched at regulatory loci, indicating their role in shaping host gene networks. Additionally, analysis of transposable elements (TEs) showed that LINEs are predominant in species such as Tragelaphus eurycerus (30.78 %), while SINEs varied, with Bubalus depressicornis at 7.78 % and Tragelaphus imberbis at 6.05 %. DNA transposons were present at 1.39 % in T. imberbis and 1.90 % in B. depressicornis. Species with higher non-repetitive DNA content, like T. buxtoni (68.72 %) and T. eurycerus (54.13 %), exhibited lower LINE abundance.",

    "abstract": "Androgen signaling during a critical embryonic window is essential for male embryonic external genitalia (eExG) development, including urethral tubularization, and defects in the androgen signaling pathway result in common congenital anomalies, such as hypospadias. To identify key regulators for eExG differentiation, we manipulated the hormonal environment of developing mouse embryos by administering testosterone propionate (TP) to pregnant dams to induce masculinization in female embryos or the androgen receptor (AR) antagonist flutamide (FLU) to induce feminization in male embryos. We performed a transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq) on eExG of E16.5 male and female embryos derived from the control and hormonally treated dams. Principal component analysis of the gene expression profiles revealed sexually intermediate gene expression patterns in TP-treated females and FLU-treated males. Based on differential gene expression analysis between control males versus females, control males versus FLU-treated males, and TP-treated females versus control females, we identified 58 male-associated and 78 female-associated genes as candidate key regulators for eExG sexual differentiation. Gene ontology analysis of these 136 candidates highlighted enrichment for mesenchymal development and organization. However, only a few of these genes contained canonical androgen response elements, suggesting frequent indirect AR regulation. By analyzing gene expression under manipulated hormonal conditions, we successfully identified candidate genes strongly associated with eExG masculinization and feminization. Our findings highlight the critical role of mesenchymal development and organization, and provide a valuable gene set for future studies on eExG development and disorders of sex development.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin interactions refer to regulatory relationships formed between chromatin regions through physical contact or spatial proximity, playing a crucial role in genome function, structure, and the development of diseases. In cancer research, for example, thinking of chromatin as a gel can help explain the spread of cancer. Traditional experimental methods, such as Hi-C and ChIA-PET, are costly, time-consuming, and applicable to only a limited number of cell lines. Increasing evidence shows that DNA sequences and genomic features (CTCF motifs, sequence conservation, chromatin-associated proteins e.g.) are essential predictors of chromatin interactions. However, existing computational methods based on these features suffer from data imbalance and low prediction accuracy, which limits their broader application in biomedical research. To address this, we proposes an entirely new model to investigate the existence of chromatin interactions based on DNA sequences and genomic features, called TECM-ChI. In this model, we first design the FCR (Forward Combine Reverse) method to balance the positive and negative samples in the K562, IMR90, and GM12878 datasets to achieve a 1:1 ratio. Additionally, to fully extract meaningful information from the gene sequences, we develop a preprocessing Three-Encoding module that uses three encoding methods to concatenate each nucleotide into a 45-dimensional vector. Next, we propose the CMANet network model, which combines multi-layer convolution with multiple attention mechanisms. CMANet effectively extracts local features within sequence information and enhances focus on key regions, improving the ability to recognize chromatin interactions. To evaluate TECM-ChI’s effectiveness, we conducted model variant experiments, loss performance analysis, and comparative analysis with existing computational methods across three cell lines. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the current best models, TECM-ChI achieves accuracy improvements of 4.68 %, 1.31 %, and 2.41 % on the K562, IMR90, and GM12878 datasets, respectively, proving its effectiveness and generalization ability in predicting chromatin interactions.

Previous studies have implicated TDMD – and, consequently, ZSWIM8/Dora – in various developmental processes. Here, we investigate the role Dora plays in Drosophila oogenesis, focusing on ovarian somatic cells. We generated a fly strain with an endogenously tagged Dora protein and observed its presence in both germline and somatic follicular cells of the ovaries. Somatic knockdown of dora revealed its essential role in normal eggshell formation. Specifically, Dora loss led to reduced chorion and vitelline transcript levels and decreased chorion gene amplification, both of which are critical for eggshell protein production. Somatic depletion of Dora reduces the Cut protein levels but did not affect the abundance of other known regulators of eggshell formation, including Ttk69, miR-7 or miR-318 indicating that Dora functions independently of these pathways. Although a direct link between TDMD and chorion eggshell development remains to be confirmed, our findings clearly highlight Dora as a critical regulator in this process. These results pave the way for further investigation into the specific role of TDMD and provide new insights into the regulatory mechanisms underlying animal oogenesis.",

In this study, involvement of circRNA molecules in goiter was investigated. A mouse model of iodine deficiency induced goiter was established and analyzed their transcriptomes via transcriptomic sequencing. Subsequent real-time quantitative PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry were used to verify the bioinformatics analysis. Transcriptomic sequencing revealed insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) was upregulated in the goiter and enriched in Ras, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling pathways. Bioinformatics analysis identified the involvement of a mmu-circ-0000554/hsa-circ-0030239-miR-363-5p-IGF1 axis and mmu-circ-0000554 and IGF1 expression were shown to be increased in goiter tissues by real-time polymerase chain reaction, an effect that was reversed by iodine-repletion treatment.

    "abstract": "Sugar transporters (STs) are important proteins responsible for the movement of sugar through the cell membrane and play pivotal roles in the growth, development, and osmoregulation of phloem-feeding hemipterans. However, information about STs in the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP), Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae), remains unknown. In this study, a total of 61 STs were identified according to the genome and transcriptome analysis of D. citri. All the ST genes have complete open reading frames (ORFs), and most of them have 12 transmembrane regions. Chromosome localization and phylogenetic tree analysis found several expansions occurred in the ST gene family. The developmental stage- and tissue-specific expression patterns of STs were characterized. Besides, feeding with different sugars and host plants altered the expression level of the top ten expressed genes in the midgut of D. citri. Furthermore, RNAi against DcST16, DcST38, DcST52, and DcST56 induced significant mortality in D. citri adults. Moreover, the swollen abdomen phenotype was observed in the adults with siRNA-DcST56 treatment. These findings lay the foundation for further function analyses of STs in D. citri.",

    "abstract": "The fatty acid desaturase 2 (FAD2) is an important functional gene in the fatty acid metabolism pathway of aromatic plants, which can significantly affect the biosynthesis of volatile compounds and the aroma characteristics. However, the possible mechanism of action of FAD2 in Chrysanthemum indicum var. aromaticum (Ci. var. aromaticum) is still unclear at present. In this study, the open reading frame (ORF) sequence of FAD2 (CiFAD2) was cloned from Ci. var. aromaticum, and it was heterologously transferred into the model plant tobacco by constructing a plant expression vector for overexpression. Then, the changes of volatiles content and species in the leaves of transgenic tobacco overexpressing CiFAD2 were analyzed by headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Results showed that compared with wild-type (WT) and empty vector (EV) tobacco, tobacco plants overexpressing CiFAD2 had a slightly delayed flowering time, darker leaf color, and smaller leaf area; the contents of terpenes increased as well as the types of alcohols and aldehydes, and new ketones were detected. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) results showed that the expression levels of key enzyme genes (ADH, AOS, KCS) in the fatty acid metabolic pathway in transgenic tobacco were all increased. This study provided data support for the potential role of CiFAD2 in the biosynthesis process of volatile/aroma compounds in Ci. var. aromaticum, which may be applicable for cultivating new types of chrysanthemum varieties with aromatic characteristics.",

    "abstract": "TSPEAR is a member of the EAR (epilepsy-associated repeat) protein family with poorly characterized function. Several lines of evidence suggest that mutations in the human TSPEAR gene are associated with hearing loss or ectodermal dysplasia. Although tooth abnormalities and a reduced capacity for caudal fin regeneration were observed in the Tspeara-/-;Tspearb-/- knockout zebrafish model, there have been no reports of the Tspear knockout mouse model to date, which hampers further investigation of its physiological role. Here, we inactivated the Tspear gene in mice using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing. Intriguingly, stereociliary morphology and auditory function remain unaffected in TSPEAR S475TfsX79 mutant mice. Similarly, tooth morphology and hair development are unaltered in these mutants. Nevertheless, the S475TfsX79 mutation appears to perturb both Notch and Wnt signaling pathways. Specifically, Notch1 and several downstream target genes are downregulated, whereas Heyl expression is upregulated in the skin. Additionally, Wnt4 expression is elevated in both the skin and inner ear. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that TSPEAR S475TfsX79 mutation does not compromise auditory function, tooth morphology, or hair development in mice, but TSPEAR may modulate both Notch and Wnt signaling pathways in the mouse.",

    "abstract": "Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is a multiple congenital anomaly/intellectual disability characterized by growth and psychomotor development delays, hallux thumbs, characteristic facial dysmorphisms with down slanting palpebral fissures, thin upper lip, high nasal bridge, arched eyebrows, micrognathia and a higher risk of tumour formation. RSTS type 1 (RSTS-1) is caused by variants of CREBBP encoding CREB-binding protein which act as transcriptional co-activators and variants of its paralog EP300 that code for E1A associated protein p300 results in RSTS type 2 (RSTS-2). CREBBP and EP300 mutations have been identified in majority (50–60 %) and minority (3–5 %) of RSTS affected individuals. It is a rare autosomal dominant disorder that affects 1 in 300,000 births. Rare diseases (RDs) are progressive, chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening heterogeneous clinical conditions that affect a limited fraction. In this article, we report a case of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome type 1, a six-year-old boy (proband) belonging to Srinagar district of the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), India established on the basis of phenotypic symptoms and radiological findings. Whole Exome Sequencing and further Array Comparative Genome Hybridization confirmed the presence of a de novo copy number variation with a 261 kb heterozygous microdeletion present on 16p13.3 cytoband (Chr16:3,694,760-3,955,374) (GRCh37/hg19) spanning three genes DNASE1 (OMIM #125505), TRAP1 (OMIM# 606219) and CREBBP (OMIM# 600140) in the proband only and missing in parents.

    "title": "SNRPB promotes gastric cancer progression via the ECM receptor signaling pathway",
    "abstract": "Gastric cancer (GC) ranks among the most common and deadly malignancies globally. Small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide (SNRPB), a core spliceosomal component, was recently identified as essential for GC cell survival, although its mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated the functions of SNRPB in GC progression and explored its underlying molecular mechanisms. SNRPB expression in GC tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues from 48 patients was analyzed via immunohistochemistry. SNRPB was significantly overexpressed in GC tissues compared with its expression in adjacent normal tissues, and higher SNRPB expression was associated with tumor stage and metastasis. Survival data obtained from the Kaplan–Meier Plotter website demonstrated that patients with GC and high SNRPB expression had a worse prognosis. Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) were successfully established from three patients with GC. These PDO models faithfully recapitulated the histological and genetic features of the original tumors. Notably, SNRPB knockdown in organoids significantly impaired organoid formation, demonstrating its essential role in maintaining tumor growth capacity. Complementary experiments in conventional 2D cultures illustrated that SNRPB knockdown reduced cell proliferation and migration. Mechanistically, transcriptomic analysis revealed that SNRPB silencing downregulated multiple genes involved in the extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor signaling pathway, thereby impairing tumor progression. In conclusion, our study identifies SNRPB as a key regulator of GC development through the ECM receptor signaling pathway, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Overexpression of efflux pumps has been associated with drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, their specific role in delamanid resistance remains unclear. This study aimed to identify efflux pump genes influenced by delamanid exposure through transcriptomic analysis.Cultures of M. tuberculosis H37Rv were exposed to delamanid at a sub-inhibitory concentration of ½ MIC for 24 h and transcriptomic sequencing was performed on exposed and unexposed cultures. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were annotated using the UniProt database.Transcriptomic analysis revealed that 23 efflux pump genes were significantly upregulated under delamanid stress, with 17/23 (73.9%) belonging to the ABC family, 4/23 (17.39%) to the RND family and 2/23 (8.69%) to the MFS superfamily. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was conducted to validate the transcriptomic results for efflux pump genes following exposure of M. tuberculosis H37Rv to delamanid at ½ and ¼ MIC. qRT-PCR confirmed that 20/23 (86.95%) genes were significantly upregulated at ½ MIC, with 14/20 (70%) of these belonging to the ABC family. In contrast, only 3/23 (13%) efflux pump genes demonstrated upregulation at ¼ MIC.This study identified a set of efflux pump genes significantly upregulated in response to sub-inhibitory concentrations of delamanid and suggested that ½ MIC is a more suitable concentration than ¼ MIC for evaluating the expression of efflux pump genes in response to delamanid in M. tuberculosis.",

    "abstract": "An enhancer is a genomic DNA sequence that substantially enhances the transcriptional activity of a target gene by recruiting transcription factors. The large clusters of enhancers identified through the ChIP-seq analysis of histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) are called super-enhancers (SEs). This study examined the dynamics of SEs during transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT. Initially, we identified the constitutive and the TGF-β1 signal-dependent SE regions across the HaCaT genome. The TGF-β1-induced SEs were observed at the loci of genes associated with the cell cycle, cell death, and extracellular matrix organization. Notably, the EMT-related mesenchymal genes such as FN1 and SERPINE1 gained the SEs on their loci in response to TGF-β1. Next, we investigated the functional role of BRD4, a transcriptional mediator that binds to the SEs, in the expression of TGF-β1-induced SE-associated genes. JQ-1, a potent inhibitor of BRD4, effectively reduced the TGF-β1-induced mRNA expression of FN1 and SERPINE1. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the rearrangement of SEs is crucial for the transcriptional regulation of the TGF-β1-induced EMT in HaCaT cells.",

In the present study, we investigated the genetic polymorphisms and forensic parameters of Chinese Baoan group based on three panels, and explored the genetic connections between the Baoan group and 26 intercontinental reference populations. Based on simulated genotyping data constructed from allele frequencies of 150 loci, the study utilized the likelihood ratio (LR) method and identical by state (IBS) method to assess the system efficacy of different panels and identification of complex kinships with the increase in the number of genetic markers. The results indicated that the 150 loci were highly polymorphic in the Baoan group, and the Baoan group was genetically closer to the reference East Asian populations. The identification efficacy of different kinships based on the 150 loci was greater than that of single panel alone or a combination of any two panels, which suggested that both the increase in the number of genetic markers and the joint analysis of different panels could enhance the system efficacy of kinship identification.

    "abstract": "Our study attempted to explore the potential treatment of thiolutin (THL), a newly confirmed NLRP3 inhibitor, on atopic dermatitis (AD). The AD model was constructed on BALB/c mice using 2,4-Dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB). THL treatment (2.5 or 10 mg/kg, every 2 days) was began on Day 7. The ear swelling and body weight of mice were monitored every three days. On day 21, after recording the scratching behaviors of each mouse, blood and skin samples were harvested to analyze serum IgE level and inflammatory cytokine production, epidermal thickness, mast cell infiltration, as well as the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome-related markers of lesional skin. THL administration attenuates AD-like symptoms stimulated by DNCB in mice, as evidenced by the quantified ear swelling, skin lesion, and scratching behaviors. THL decreased the systemic IgE level and the production of IL-5 and IL-4 in the lesional ear skin of the AD model mice. DNCB-induced epidermal thickening and lesional mast cell infiltration were reduced by THL. THL significantly suppressed the DNCB-induced upregulation of NLRP3, ASC, and Caspase-1 in lesional skin. Once NLRP3 was knocked out, the protection of THL against AD was diminished. THL can protect against experimental AD by blocking NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Our findings make THL a potentially therapeutic agent for AD.",

    "abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a multifaceted autoimmune disorder, has lupus nephritis (LN) as one of its grave complications and is strongly associated with dyslipidemia. This investigation sought to delineate renal-specific lipid metabolism-related genes (LMRGs) signatures in lupus nephritis (LN) through integrated bioinformatics analysis and explore the therapeutic effect of Alisol B 23-acetate (ABA). Analysis of LN datasets revealed multiple dysregulated pathways and identified 11 key LMRGs, including CD36, associated with LN. In vitro, ABA suppressed CD36 activity, thereby reducing inflammation and lipid accumulation. In vivo, ABA improved lipid metabolism, attenuated immune cell infiltration, and ameliorated renal pathology. Renal lipid metabolic reprogramming exacerbates LN pathology, and ABA shows potential in treating LN by regulating key LMRGs.",

Genotyping was performed using competitive allele-specific PCR. Data on HbA1c levels as a measure of glycemic control, and information on late complications, including ischemic heart disease, retinopathy, and nephropathy, was obtained from the medical records. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between selected genetic polymorphisms and patients outcomes. Significant associations were observed between KEAP1 rs9676881 (p < 0.001) and NFE2L2 rs6721961 (p = 0.006) polymorphisms and elevated HbA1c levels. Additionally, NFE2L2 rs35652124 polymorphism was linked to a nominally higher risk of late complications, including ischemic heart disease (p = 0.036), retinopathy (p = 0.032), and nephropathy (p = 0.026). Results indicate that polymorphisms in the KEAP1 and NFE2L2 genes may influence glycemic control and the development of late complications in T2DM patients.

    "title": "Haplotype analysis and molecular marker development of the COLD1 for cold stress tolerance at the germination stage in rice",
    "abstract": "Cold tolerance during the germination stage is a critical agronomic trait that influences the geographic adaptation and yield stability of rice. In this study, we systematically analyzed genetic variations of the COLD1 gene using the 3 K Rice Core Collection, revealing significant associations between haplotypes and cold tolerance at the germination stage. We identified two key SNPs (SNP145938700 and SNP145938916) in the upstream regulatory region of COLD1, which stratified the population into three distinct haplotypes: Hap1, Hap2, and Hap3. An association analysis of 493 germplasms subjected to cold stress demonstrated that Hap2 (SNP145938700-AA/SNP145938916-TT) exhibited superior cold tolerance, with a seedling survival rate of 62.76 %, significantly higher than that of Hap1 (55.88 %) and Hap3 (48.25 %) (P < 0.01). Haplotype distribution analysis across 2,840 germplasms revealed that Hap2, predominantly found in japonica subspecies (TEJ/TRJ), has a latitudinal adaptation advantage, suggesting its genomic architecture harbors unique cold-adaptive modules. We developed two kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) markers, Cold1-1-kasp and Cold1-2-kasp, to differentiate between Hap1 (TT/GG), Hap2 (AA/TT), and Hap3 (AA/GG) with 100 % accuracy. Validation using 35 rice germplasms for production applications confirmed that carriers of Hap2 exhibited significantly higher seedling survival rates than those of Hap3. Furthermore, molecular marker-assisted selection (MAS) was employed to introgress Hap2 from the cold-tolerant donor Meixiangzhan 2 into the cold-sensitive cultivar R9311, resulting in the novel cold-tolerant germplasm RY218. In BC2F5 generations, RY218 achieved a seedling survival rate of 69.17 %, representing a seven-fold improvement over the recurrent parent. This study establishes COLD1 Hap2 as a key genetic determinant of germination stage cold tolerance and provides robust KASP markers for precision breeding in rice.",

    "abstract": "Owing to the high prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infections and the increasing rates of antibiotic resistance, the development of a potent vaccine against H. pylori infection has become an urgent need. In this study, we screened three linear B-cell dominant epitopes, 16 helper T-cell dominant epitopes, 20 cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) dominant epitopes, and conformational epitopes from the UreB, CagA, and VacA proteins using immunoinformatics approaches. To enhance vaccine affinity, dominant epitopes were linked to the extracellular domain of CTLA-4 using appropriate linkers, resulting in the formation of a multi-epitope vaccine. Subsequently, the rationality of the vaccine protein sequence was validated, and absence of allergenic properties was confirmed. Molecular dynamics and docking simulations demonstrated strong stability in the interactions between the vaccine proteins with B7, Toll like receptor (TLR)-2, and TLR-4. Additionally, immune simulations indicated that the constructed vaccine effectively induced both humoral and cellular immune responses. Ultimately, the refined DNA sequence of the vaccine was incorporated into the pMV261 vector of the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) shuttle expression plasmid to enhance efficacy via BCG delivery. Preliminary experimental validation using western blotting and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay confirmed that the vaccine’s structural integrity and its ability to elicit a strong immune response in the host, providing valuable insights for the advancement of H. pylori vaccine development.",

    "abstract": "Soil salinization severely impairs plant growth, development, and crop productivity. The transcription factor CbbHLH147 in Cinnamomum bodinieri has been implicated in the alkali stress response. This study investigated the functional role of CbbHLH147 by transforming it into Arabidopsis thaliana and conducting transcriptome sequencing under alkali stress. The coding sequence (CDS) sequence of CbbHLH147 is 588-bp long, assumably encoding an hydrophilic, lipid-soluble, and alkaline protein. CbbHLH147 was predicted to localized to nucleus. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated high conservation of CbbHLH147 within Lauraceae, suggesting a role in abiotic stress adaptation. Transgenic Arabidopsis lines (T147) exhibited enhanced alkali tolerance compared to wild-type (WT). Transcriptome profiling of T147 relative to wide type (WT) under alkali stress revealed up-regulation of many genes (DEGs) involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, nitrogen metabolism, circadian rhythm, and anthocyanin biosynthesis, and also downregulation of DEGs in pathways of photosynthesis-antenna proteins, photosynthesis, glutathione metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, zeatin biosynthesis, beta-Alanine metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism. The key flavonoid metabolism genes include AT5G13930 (CHS), AT5G42800 (DFR), AT1G30530 (UGT78D1), and AT4G27560 (UGTs), which were significantly upregulated in T147 versus WT.

    "abstract": "It is not easy to construct an accurate dysfunction model of human pancreatic islet cells under high glucose burden in in vitro culture because long-term culture of human pancreatic islet cells while retaining their function is difficult. We previously showed alginate encapsulation enabled human islet cells to maintain glucose responsiveness for long-term in vitro culture. Using this capsulation method, we cultured human islet cells for 4 weeks under normal or high glucose conditions. We confirmed that disruption of glucose responsiveness in human islet cells was elicited by high glucose charge, but not under normal glucose conditions. To investigate the mechanism of this disruption, we RNA sequenced cultured samples under normal or high glucose conditions using two different batches. We picked up common down- or up-regulation genes in two different batches under high glucose load and, compared them with those under normal glucose levels. The number of common down-regulation genes was 96, and that of common up-regulation genes was 174. We validated the changes of expression level of each candidate gene in beta cells using single-cell RNA sequencing data, and we further extracted 7 out of 96 common down-regulation genes and 8 out of 174 common up-regulation genes. These genes are putative causal genes for beta cell dysfunction. Moreover, we found that the proinsulin to C-peptide ratio increased, and mature insulin granules decreased under high glucose conditions, suggesting that impaired glucose responsiveness was caused to some extent by the abnormal status of insulin granules.",

    "abstract": "Worldwide, breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women. Current research reveals that lncRNA/miRNA/mRNA axes are involved in several cancers. The lncRNA NEAT1 sponging of miR-20b-5p and STAT3 regulation by miR-20b-5p have previously been established. The clinicopathological relationship between NEAT1 and the miR-20b-5p/STAT3 axis in breast cancers is unknown. This study aims to investigate the clinicopathological associations and significance of NEAT1/miR-20b-5p/STAT3 axes in breast cancer. qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry were performed on archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded breast tumor tissues (n = 79) and adjacent normal tissues (n = 40). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis examined NEAT1 and miR-20b-5p diagnostic value. The qRT-PCR revealed significantly higher total NEAT1 and NEAT1_2 isoform levels in breast tumors compared to normal tissues with significant associations with ER, PR statuses, age, stages, and lymph node metastasis (p < 0.05). Methylation-specific PCR of DNA showed that normal and tumor samples had distinct NEAT1 promoter methylation (p < 0.05). Immunohistochemistry showed that tumors and normal tissues have differing STAT3 protein expression, and significantly correlated with NEAT1 levels (p < 0.05). Bioinformatics analysis predicted STAT3 targeting hsa-miR-20b-5p and substantial NEAT1_2 isoform interaction with hsa-miR-20b-5p. qRT-PCR revealed low levels of hsa-miR-20b-5p and an inverse correlation with NEAT1 and NEAT1_2 levels in tumors (p < 0.05). NEAT1 and miR-20b-5p have diagnostic values according to ROC curves. Knockdown of NEAT1 in MCF7 cells by siRNA increased hsa-miR-20b-5p levels and decreased STAT3 mRNA. CCND1 expression correlated with the expression of its transcriptional activator STAT3 in MCF7 cells and tumor tissues. Overall, the study suggests NEAT1/hsa-miR-20b-5p/STAT3 axes as a potential biomarker in breast tumors.",

    "abstract": "The rampant outbreak of smut disease has led to a sharp decline in the yield and quality of Rheum officinale Baill. (R. officinale), therefore, research on the molecular mechanisms and regulatory pathways of smut disease is urgent. After long-term observation and screening, we identified three-year-old healthy R. officinale plants that had not yet developed disease in the infected area, and selected infected plants as controls. GO and KEGG functional enrichment analyses revealed significantly enriched GO terms and metabolic pathways. We obtained 20 DEGs that were highly enriched in infected plants compared with healthy plants, including a broad-spectrum disease resistance gene named nonexpressor of pathogenesis-related gene 1 (RoNPR1). And we found that during the occurrence of smut disease, RoPW220, RoNPR1, and RoWRKY40 were highly enriched and has a significant effect on the production of important secondary metabolites such as anthraquinone in R. officinale. Analysis revealed that the structural domains and protein functions of RoNPR1 are highly conserved. The RoNPR1 gene is located in the nucleus and is expressed in various tissues. The occurrence of smut induces a high accumulation of mRNA transcripts of the RoNPR1 gene in stems, leaves, and petioles. As the invasion of stems deepens, the expression level of the RoNPR1 gene increases more significantly from stage Ⅰ to stage Ⅴ. During stages Ⅴ to VIII, the expression level of the RoNPR1 gene gradually decreases, indicating that smut disease may have caused severe damage to the growth of R. officinale. Through yeast hybridization, we verified that RoNPR1 physically interacts with the bZIP transcription factors TGACG sequence-specific binding protein 1 (RoTGA1), RoTGA2, RoTGA3, RoTGA5, and RoTGA8. In R. officinale, RoNPR3 and RoNPR4 may also play a role in the occurrence of smut disease. These results will help understanding the specific genes involved in the resistance to the smut disease.",

    "title": "Genome-wide identification of GH3 β-glucosidase members reveals NtBGLC12 improves growth in tobacco plants",
    "abstract": "β-Glucosidase (BGL, EC 3.2.1.21), a glycoside hydrolase, participates in cellulose metabolism and modulates various physiological and biochemical pathways. However, its role in regulating plant growth remains poorly understood. In this study, 19 GH3 β-glucosidase genes (NtBGLCs) were identified in Nicotiana tabacum through genome-wide screening and were phylogenetically classified into two evolutionarily distinct clades. The encoded proteins (418–1254 aa) possess conserved Glyco_hydro_3_C catalytic domains and BglX structural motifs. Transcriptional profiling revealed a significant positive correlation (Pearson’s r = 0.82, P < 0.05) between NtBGLC12 expression levels and leaf biomass 45 days after transplanting. NtBGLC12 exhibited spatiotemporal specificity, with expression remaining stable in stems but increasing progressively in leaves and roots throughout the growth period. Transgenic lines overexpressing NtBGLC12 displayed enhanced growth at the seedling stage (six-true-leaf stage), including a 57.1 % increase in plant height, 51.4 % longer leaves, and 37.7 % wider leaves compared to wild type (WT). Notably, these growth advantages diminished at post-maturation (90 days after transplanting), showing only 6.74 %, 5.30 %, and 6.84 % increases, respectively. Biochemical analyses indicated that NtBGLC12 overexpression elevated β-glucosidase activity by 30 %, increased glucose (33.9 %), soluble sugar (9.87 %), and hemicellulose (11.9 %) content, while reducing cellulose accumulation by 9.05 %. These findings establish NtBGLC12 as a regulator of tobacco growth and implicate its role in cell wall remodeling, offering a novel strategy for enhancing crop productivity.",

    "title": "Impact of PLA2G2A rs11573156 C > G Variant on Phospholipase Expression and Metastatic Behavior in Prostate Cancer",
    "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is a major global health concern and a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men. Despite available treatments, PCa frequently recurs and exhibits high metastatic potential. One key factor in its malignancy is PLA2G2A, a secretory phospholipase A2 enzyme with strong inflammatory properties. Elevated PLA2G2A levels in the bloodstream have been linked to tumor grade, potentially due to the rs11573156 C > G polymorphism in the gene’s 5′ untranslated region (5′UTR). Previously, we demonstrated that individuals carrying the G allele have a 2.5-fold lower risk of developing metastatic PCa compared to those with the C allele. To further investigate the functional impact of this polymorphism, we employed CRISPR-Cas9 base editing to convert the GC genotype of metastatic PC-3 prostate cancer cells into the homozygous GG genotype. Our findings indicate that the G allele enhances PLA2G2A expression while downregulating genes associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), an effect reversed upon siRNA-mediated PLA2G2A silencing. Furthermore, this genetic alteration impaired the migratory capacity of PC-3 cells following interferon-γ (IFN-γ) priming, simulating an inflammatory tumor microenvironment. Notably, siRNA-induced downregulation of PLA2G2A reversed the anti-migratory effects associated with the GG genotype. Our results suggest that increased PLA2G2A expression, driven by the G allele, negatively affects cell proliferation, EMT, and metastatic properties, underscoring its potential anti-tumor role in PCa.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to explore the effects of the Ovocalyxin-32 (OCX-32) gene overexpression on the calcium ions (Ca2+) concentration and lipid metabolism indicators in chicken uterine epithelial cells. Uterine epithelial cells from Changshun Green-shelled hens were isolated and cultured using type IV collagenase. The pcDNA3.1(+)-OCX-32 + Flag expression vector was constructed and transfected into the cells. The Ca2+ concentration and lipid indicators such as total cholesterol (TCHO), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and triglycerides (TG) were measured using colorimetric methods. Group comparison results showed that Ca2+ concentration was significantly lower (P < 0.05), and TCHO was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the OCX-32 overexpression group compared to the control group, while TG and other indicators did not show significant differences. In addition, correlation analysis across individual samples revealed that OCX-32 overexpression was significantly negatively correlated with Ca2+ concentration (r = −0.82, P < 0.05), significantly positively correlated with TG concentration (r = 0.83, P < 0.05), and extremely significantly negatively correlated with TCHO concentration (r = −0.94, P < 0.01). Additionally, a highly significant negative correlation was found between TCHO and TG concentrations (r = −0.96, P < 0.01). These results suggested that the overexpression of OCX-32 may regulate calcium homeostasis and lipid metabolism in chicken uterine epithelial cells by affecting Ca2+ transport and lipid synthesis pathways, providing experimental evidence for further elucidating the mechanisms of OCX-32 in calcium and lipid regulation during eggshell formation.",

    "abstract": "Inositol triphosphate receptor type III (IP3R3) is a key second messenger that mediates the release of intracellular Calcium ion (Ca2+). It binds to inositol triphosphate (IP3) to form a calcium channel, regulating intracellular calcium homeostasis. This study aimed to analyze IP3R3 mRNA expression in duck tissues and its single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) association with eggshell quality. Forty-five-week-old Guizhou Sansui ducks were used as experimental subjects. The real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) assessed gene expression, while SNPs were identified via PCR products sequencing. The association between SNPs, diplotypes, and eggshell quality was analyzed using SPSS 18.0. Four SNPs were identified in the IP3R3 gene: g.16132 C > T (exon 8), g.35267 T > C (exon 50), g.35279 G > A (exon 50), and g.35497 C > A (exon 51). All four SNPs were synonymous mutations that did not alter the encoded amino acids. The SNP g.16132 C > T polymorphism significantly affected eggshell thickness (P < 0.05). Diplotypes H1H1 and H2H2 were significantly greater than the eggshell thickness of H1H2 and H5H5 individuals (P < 0.05). Diplotypes H1H2 and H5H5 significantly increased eggshell strength, while H1H5 significantly improved the egg shape index. Additionally, H1H3 significantly enhanced egg weight and eggshell weight. The IP3R3 mRNA was expressed at varying levels across 11 tissues in Sansui ducks, with the highest expression in the eggshell gland, followed by the heart, spleen, glandular stomach, pancreas, kidney, liver, small intestine, lung, breast muscle, and masticatory stomach. The IP3R3 gene can serve as an important candidate gene, with potential application as a molecular marker in poultry breeding programs, including marker-assisted selection (MAS) and genomic selection, to improve eggshell quality in laying ducks.",

Inconsistent data reported for several candidate gene polymorphisms contributing on schizophrenia development, previously. The case-control study was conducted with 102 schizophrenia patients and 150 control subjects. HTR2A (rs6311), TPH2 (rs1386494), NRG1 (rs3924999 and rs2954041), DISC1 (rs821616 and rs6675281) and ERBB4 (rs7424835 and rs4673628) gene polymorphisms were detected by allele specific PCR and RFLP. Genetic analysis were performed by SNPAlyze 9.0 and STATA 13.0 software. Also, multidimensional regression analysis was used to determine the SNP-SNP interaction. T allele of rs821616 DISC1 and G allele of rs4673628 ERBB4, were associated with increased risk of schizophrenia. Significant difference was observed for heterozygous G/A genotype of rs6311 (G/A vs G/G + A/A, OR = 2.11; 95 % CI, 1.25–3.54, p = 0.005).

While earlier studies have provided foundational insights into the genetic diversity and population structure of the species, they lack the resolution necessary for in-depth evolutionary, functional, and applied genomic analyses. In this study, the chromosome-level genome assembly of the Nao-zhou stock was constructed by combining MGI (MGISEQ-2000), and PacBio (Pacific Biosciences) HiFi and Hi-C sequencing methods. The results showed that the assembled genome size was 726 Mb, of which 98.27 % (723 Mb) of the sequences were anchored to 24 chromosomes and the proportion of complete genes reached 98.7 %. In the genome annotation, 31.04 % of the repetitive sequences in the genome were identified, with 24,796 protein-coding genes predicted, of which 99.47 % (24,664 genes) were successfully annotated.

    "title": "Comparative genomics of Bacillus anthracis A and B-clades reveals genetic variation in genes responsible for spore germination",
    "abstract": "Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax, is composed of three genetic clades (A, B, and C). Clade-A is the most common and distributed worldwide, B-clade has a narrow geographic distribution, and C-clade is rare. South Africa's Kruger National Park (KNP) has high diversity of B. anthracis, with strains from A and B clades described from its northernmost region, Pafuri. We employed whole genome sequencing to investigate the genomic diversity of B. anthracis strains isolated from animal carcasses (n = 34) during the 2012–2015 outbreaks. Whole-genome single-nucleotide polymorphism (wgSNP) analysis assigned the 2012–2015 B. anthracis genomes to the A-clade branch, distributed across the branch's two minor sub-clades A.Br.005/006. Additionally, pan-genomic analysis distinguished the A- and B-clade genomes, identifying unique accessory genes. Notable genetic differences include the biosynthetic spore cell wall genes; long-chain fatty acid CoA ligases (FaD13), Bacillus collagen-like protein of anthracis (BclA) involved in the exosporium germination, as well as a truncated murein DD-endopeptidase (mepH) found in the pXO2 plasmid of the B-clade strains. The tryptophan synthase subunit alpha gene (trpA), which results in a pseudogene in B-clade genomes separates the A- and B-clade genomes. These differences in biosynthetic cell wall genes suggest variation in adaptability or cell growth of the B-clade strains in the environment, further influenced by the truncation of the trpA gene involved in spore germination. The A.Br.005/006-clade strains in KNP exhibit higher genetic diversity, which may enhance their resilience to environmental stressors. In contrast, the KNP B-clade (B.Br.001/002) strains show limited genetic variation, potentially reducing their adaptability. This pattern is evident through whole-genome SNP analysis and pan-genomics investigating the evolution of B. anthracis.",

    "abstract": "The ever-growing plastics production and their natural fragmentation in micro- and nanoparticles have made plastic debris ubiquitous, with aquatic environments as the final collection basin. Plastic pollution is responsible for physical damage and biological pathways disruption in marine animals at almost all trophic levels, interfering with primary processes as development, growth, and reproduction. Micro- and nanoplastics accumulate in the food chain and represent a concrete risk for human health. Mussels have a worldwide spread and, as a starring seafood product, may constitute an important vehicle for microplastic uptake in humans.Micro- and nanoplastics affect biological processes at the nuclear level, altering DNA methylation and gene regulators, including long non-coding (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs). MicroRNAs, interacting with several mRNA targets, can prompt several processes, including antioxidant responses, inflammation, immune system cell recruitment, up to apoptosis.The present study investigates the impact of microplastic particles on the modulation of microRNAs in adult mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis and the identification of microRNA-mRNA regulatory network. In this work, we exposed adult mussels to different concentrations and several temporal window to polystyrene monodispersed microparticles and analysed the expression of selected microRNAs and related target genes. Our results revealed that microplastic exposure induces miRNAs modulation and target genes associated with the activation of specific regulatory networks, including immune response, cellular stimuli response, protein interactions, apoptosis, and cell death.This study provides new insights into the microplastic capability to affect gene expression and regulatory pathways mRNA miRNA-regulated, contributing to wider knowledge about the adverse effects of plastic pollution and providing useful data for further trials, not just in nature, but also in human health.",

    "abstract": "Previous research studies confirmed that resveratrol (RES) and β-hydroxy-β-methyl butyric acid (HMB) regulated the glucolipid metabolism. However, the mechanism underlying of RES and HMB on subcutaneous fat remains unclear in ruminant. This study investigated the effects of dietary RES and HMB supplementation on immune, oxidative, and morphological changes in subcutaneous fat of Tibetan sheep using transcriptomics and metabolomics analysis. One hundred and twenty male Tibetan lambs of similar initial weight (15.5 ± 0.14 kg) were randomly divided into four groups of 30 lambs each: 1) H group (basal diet without RES or HMB); 2) H-RES group (1.5 g/day RES); 3) H-HMB group (1250 mg/day HMB); and 4) H-RES-HMB group (1.5 g/day RES and 1250 mg/day HMB). The study included a pre-test period of 10 days and a formal experimental period of 90 days. The results showed that, the supplementation of RES and HMB in combination reduced the backfat thickness and adipocyte diameter (P < 0.05). Notably, dietary RES and HMB significantly influenced the composition of fatty acid in subcutaneous fat, including increased monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), such as C16:1 N7, C18:1 N9, C20:1 N9, C22:1 N9, C24:1 N9, C24:1 N, and decreased saturated fatty acid (SFA), such as C8:0, C10:0, C11:0, C24:0. The H-RES-HMB group enriched in the lipid-related signaling pathways, including “linoleic acid”, “arachidonic acid”, “tyrosine” and “retinol”. The transcriptome and metabolome indicated ten key genes including PLA2G5, PLA2G2D, PTGES, TBXAS1, ALOX5, MAOA, TYR, UGT1A4, RDH5, and DHRS9) and five metabolites including PC(33:4), LPC(22:0), LPC(15:0), LPC(16:1), PC(42:8) were identified as key biomarkers.

This study aimed to investigate the genetic characteristics of GBS isolates in a hospital setting. Nineteen isolates were identified through a review of preservation and cultivation processes since January 2022, followed by antibiotic susceptibility testing. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was used to investigate genetic relationships. Among 19 isolates, serotype V was the most prevalent (n = 7), followed by Ib (n = 6) and III (n = 6). Genomic sequence analysis revealed that 19 isolates belonged to four sequence types (STs) related to four clonal complexes (CCs), namely CC12, CC19, CC327, and CC452. The isolates exhibited high resistance rates to erythromycin (89 %, n = 17), levofloxacin (79 %, n = 15), clindamycin (68 %, n = 13), and tetracycline (53 %, n = 10). The mreA gene was found in all GBS isolates (100 %), while the most prevalent resistance gene was ermB (84 %). Furthermore, the fbsB virulence gene associated with adherence was identified in four serotype V/ST890 GBS isolates. Two isolates with different sequence types (ST10, ST19) were found to have undergone parallel mutations in the gene SE858_09425, which encodes a DNA translocase FtsK.

In Spain and many other countries, this is mostly driven by Illumina-based sequencing, while Oxford Nanopore Tecnologies' MinION Mk1C is a low-cost, faster, and user-friendly sequencer. We aimed to evaluate the applicability of the Mk1C device with a long-amplicon PCR approach for SARS-CoV-2 rapid genomic surveillance and outbreak characterization. We compared the technical and practical performance of this workflow with the short-amplicon strategy on Illumina's MiSeq platform. We processed 183 PCR-positive nasopharyngeal samples, one positive control derived from a clinical sample, and two synthetic SARS-CoV-2 controls for both sequencing workflows. Good quality sequences were obtained by both methods: their mean breadth coverage was 99 % for both techniques and while mean depth of coverage was 1.78-fold lower for MinION (990× vs 557×), no single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) differences were observed between paired synthetic controls and neither for most of the clinical samples (149/158, 94.3 %). Pango lineage assignments were totally concordant, which were mainly from the Omicron variant. Only one sample showed differences in sublineage assignment. Nanopore workflow had 1.3-fold shorter turnaround time to results for large batches of surveillance samples (96-well plate), and 4.1-fold for the study of small batches of outbreak-related samples. Nanopore sequencing had also a 4.5-fold lower cost per sample, considering consumables and reagents.

Different local environments exert distinct selective pressures on innate immunity. Here, we conducted a systematic analysis of innate immune gene variations and their evolutionary patterns in high-altitude populations using large-scale genomic data. The result posed that Tibetans harbored 26 Darwinian-positive selection genes, and they may confer protection against pulmonary hypertension by reducing infiltration and inflammatory responses and preventing cardiac hypertrophy. In particularly, we discovered four genes, OAS3, IRAK4, RAB11A, and PLK1 with strong signals of positive selection. These genes are hypothesized to contribute to resistance against hepatitis B infection and the development of tolerance in Tibetans.

    "abstract": "This study aimed to elucidate the epigenomic differences between diploid and tetraploid Chinese cabbage seeds and preliminarily explore the mechanisms underlying the reduced seed vigor in tetraploid seeds. We comprehensively analyzed the transcriptome, metabolome, and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) to investigate gene expression, metabolite profiles, and DNA methylation patterns in diploid and tetraploid Chinese cabbage seeds from different years.Results showed that tetraploid seeds exhibited lower DNA methylation levels and fewer methylated cytosines than diploid seeds across all sequence contexts (CG, CHG, and CHH). Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were predominantly enriched in upstream and downstream regions of genes, with a higher number of hypermethylated regions in diploid seeds. Transcriptomic analysis revealed significant changes in gene expression before and after germination, with more genes downregulated post-germination. KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that differentially expressed genes were mainly involved in carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and signal transduction pathways. Metabolome analysis identified 1346 metabolites, with flavonoids and plant hormone signal transduction pathways being the most prominent. Notably, ABA-related genes, including seven ABF genes, 18 PYR/PYL genes, six SRK genes, and two PP2C genes, exhibited differential methylation and expression patterns between diploid and tetraploid seeds. These genes were enriched in pathways related to secondary metabolite biosynthesis and plant hormone signaling, suggesting a potential role in the reduced seed vigor of tetraploid seeds. In conclusion, our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the epigenetic and transcriptional characteristics underlying the differences in seed vigor between diploid and tetraploid Chinese cabbage seeds. The findings highlight the importance of DNA methylation and ABA signaling in regulating seed development and vigor.",

Lawsonella clevelandensis, the currently recognized sole species in the genus Lawsonella, has gained increased attention as a cause of abscesses but is often overlooked due to its fastidious nature, which make its isolation and culture in the lab particularly challenging. Here, a comprehensive genomic investigation of Lawsonella was conducted using a cultivation-free metagenomic approach, focusing on 39 newly generated and 12 publicly available genomes. A novel species represented by 43 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) was proposed based on mono-clade formation, 16S rDNA sequence similarity and genome-wide average nucleotide identity (ANI) values.

    "title": "Exploring the mechanism of action of trastuzumab-induced cardiomyocyte atrophy based on the FN1/PI3K/AKT-mediated mTOR-independent signaling pathway",
    "abstract": "Trastuzumab (TRZ) is a standard drug for the treatment of HER-2-positive breast cancer, but its cardiotoxicity seriously affects the prognosis of patients, and the potential mechanism of TRZ-induced cardiomyocyte atrophy leading to cardiotoxicity remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the potential targets and signaling pathways of TRZ-induced cardiotoxicity using single-cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bioinformatics methods. A total of 618 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified through scRNA-seq and bioinformatics analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis, Reactome analysis, Wiki pathway analysis, Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network analysis, and Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) results indicated that immune cell-derived FN1 may play a pivotal role in TRZ-induced cardiotoxicity by activating PI3K/AKT-mediated mTOR-independent signaling pathways in cardiomyocytes through extracellular matrix (ECM) mechanisms. Western blot analysis revealed that the expression of FN1, p-PI3K/PI3K, and p-AKT/AKT proteins was elevated in the TRZ group, no elevation of p-mTOR/mTOR and the autophagy level of cardiomyocytes was elevated, as well as the levels of myocardial atrophy and apoptosis were enhanced after treatment with TRZ. TEM revealed increased autolysosomes in TRZ-treated samples, while immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated exacerbated myocardial injury and significant cardiomyocyte atrophy in the TRZ group compared to CON. Our results demonstrate that TRZ-primed immune cells release FN1 which, through ECM triggers non-canonical (mTOR-independent) PI3K/AKT signaling in cardiomyocytes. This aberrant pathway drives excessive autophagy, initiating a pathological cascade from cellular atrophy to apoptotic death and ultimately manifesting as clinical cardiotoxicity.",

    "title": "Candidate effector proteins revealed by transcriptional profiling during development of Moniliophthora roreri, a fungal pathogen of Theobroma cacao",
    "abstract": "Frosty pod rot (FPR), caused by Moniliophthora roreri, is one of the most devastating diseases of cocoa plantations in the Americas. This hemibiotrophic fungus only infects the fruits of the cocoa tree. It reduces yields and devalues the fruits, consequently causing economic losses and compromising crops' socioeconomic potential. We analyzed the transcriptome of M. roreri spores and mycelium incubated in a cocoa fruit extract from susceptible plants. A total of 871 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in spores at different incubation times and in mycelium. The identified DEGs were found to be involved in several biological processes and molecular functions, among them oxidoreductase function, proteolysis, transcriptional regulation, binding processes and stress response. We also explored the repertoire of secreted proteins and putative effectors located in the apoplast and cytoplasm of the host, and found 1075 transcripts encoding secreted proteins, of which 61 were DEGs and 23 were putative effectors, associated with plant cell wall breakdown, oxidative stress, and carbohydrate metabolism. Data also revealed transcripts with up to 50-fold higher expression between the incubation times of non-germinated spores and mycelium, which are considered candidates for marker genes in fungal development. These molecules were related to functions such as growth, pathogenicity, kinase and oxidoreductase activity, playing important roles in the interaction of M. roreri and Theobroma cacao. Functional analysis of three candidate effectors revealed impacts on leaf morphology, mainly leaf drying and wilting, often culminating in necrosis. Our results expand the understanding of the molecular basis of how FPR affects host plants, in addition to identifying a set of secreted proteins that require functional characterization to contribute to disease control.",

We connected intricate details of genomic patterns of DNA damage with physiological properties of cells. We found an intriguing relationship between single-nucleotide hotspots of DNA damage and naturally occurring sequence variants, suggesting that certain regions of the genome are more prone to DNA damage which can lead to heritable sequence change.

Here, we integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles of drought-stressed sugarcane to decipher the regulatory mechanisms. Using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS), we identified 157 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 18 differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) specifically induced under drought stress. These DEGs/DAMs were co-enriched in 2-oxocarboxylic acid metabolism and branched-chain amino acid (valine/leucine/isoleucine) degradation pathways. Through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), we pinpointed three hub metabolites, tryptophan, proline, and 6-methylquinoline (6-MQ), exhibit a significant correlation with DEGs. Functional validation demonstrated that exogenous 6-MQ application significantly enhanced drought tolerance in sugarcane (17.6 % lower mortality) without growth penalty.

Current genotyping methods often fail to capture the full range of FLG variants, especially in regions with high sequence homology. To overcome this limitation, we developed a singleplex PCR method that amplifies FLG exon 3 using FLG-specific primers tailed with barcodes for sample identification, followed by long-read sequencing on the PacBio Sequel IIe system. After demultiplexing with the barcode sequences, pbmm2 and GATK HaplotypeCaller were used for alignment and variant calling, respectively. This method successfully identified single nucleotide variants, insertion-deletion variants, and copy number variations (CNVs), including several loss-of-function mutations. We also determined the FLG copy number in each allele, which ranged from 7 to 20 repeats. This comprehensive, convenient genotyping approach could significantly enhance diagnostic accuracy and personalized treatment strategies for allergy- and skin-related conditions.",

    "abstract": "Alternative splicing (AS) plays a crucial role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, influencing skeletal muscle growth and development. However, research into transcriptomic landscape of AS and its key isoforms associated with skeletal muscle in goats is comparatively limited compared with other livestock species such as pigs. In this study, longissimus dorsi muscles from 4 Macheng black goats and 4 Boer goats were used to perform Oxford Nanopore Technologies full-length sequencing and Illumina RNA-seq. A total of 91,874 unique full-length non-chimeric sequences and 10,955 novel isoforms were identified. Subsequently, we detected 13,866 AS events and 1702 novel long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), with exon skipping (4024, 29.02 %) being the most prevalent AS event. In addition, a total of 2267 differentially expressed isoforms (DEIs) were identified between Macheng black and Boer goats. Among these DEIs, 1301 isoforms were up-regulated and 966 were down-regulated in Macheng black goats. Functional enrichment analyses revealed that these DEIs were predominantly associated with pathways related to skeletal muscle development, cellular metabolic processes, and genetic information processing. Notably, we identified LUC7L-201 as an important isoform that negatively regulates cell proliferation and differentiation in goat primary myoblasts, as demonstrated by overexpression experiments. Overall, this study enhances our understanding of the transcriptomic diversity underlying skeletal muscle growth and development in goats, providing valuable insights for future research and potential applications in livestock management.",

    "title": "Integrating multi-omics analysis unveils the key mechanisms of PQS-enhanced Algicidal activity in Enterobacter hormaechei F2",
    "abstract": "Quorum sensing, as a pivotal bacterial signaling pathway, exhibits substantial potential for regulating algicidal activity. This study pioneers the integration of multi-omics analyses (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) with phenotypic profiling to systematically unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying Pseudomonas Quinolone Signal (2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinolinone, PQS)-enhanced algicidal activity in Enterobacter hormaechei F2. Co-cultivation with PQS triggered marked reductions in algal biomass and chlorophyll-a levels, outperforming traditional approaches. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) revealed PQS-induced metabolic disruption and membrane degradation in algal cells. Transcriptomic profiling identified novel regulatory hubs, including upregulated glycolysis (tktA, transketolase), fatty acid degradation (fadE, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase), and chemotaxis (malE, maltose-binding protein) pathways. Proteomics confirmed PQS-driven enrichment of terpenoid precursors, notably DXS synthase (1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase), and quorum sensing effectors. Metabolomics highlighted amino acid derivatives (e.g., L-glutamate) and heterocyclic antibiotics as dominant algicidal metabolites. Crucially, multi-omics integration delineated a core network of 46 key nodes (e.g., ribose transporter rbsB, L-glutamate) coordinating energy metabolism, motility, and algicide synthesis. Fatty acid degradation enzymes (e.g., FadE) and flagellar assembly regulators (e.g., FlgK) emerged as previously unrecognized targets, with PQS significantly enhancing bacterial swarming motility (p < 0.01) and biofilm formation. These findings establish the first mechanistic framework linking PQS signaling to algicidal process, demonstrating its role in synchronizing metabolic flux toward terpenoid synthesis while optimizing bacterial-algal interactions. Key pathways—including chemotaxis (malE) and terpenoid biosynthesis (DXS synthase)—provide actionable targets for engineering bioaugmented consortia or precision algicidal formulations. This work advances quorum sensing-driven strategies for sustainable harmful algal bloom (HAB) mitigation, offering scalable solutions for aquaculture and eutrophic water remediation with minimal ecological disruption. By bridging molecular mechanisms to field applications, the study underscores the translational potential of this approach in global water security initiatives.",

    "title": "Deciphering common bean (Phaseolus Vulgaris L.) microbiome assemblages reveal mechanistic insights into host-pathogen-microbiome interactions",
    "abstract": "Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is the primary source of proteins and nutrients in most households in sub-Saharan Africa. However, production of this crop is constrained by several biotic factors. While research on common bean plant-pathogen interactions has predominantly focused on binary relationships, the diversity of microbes naturally inhabiting plant tissues and their interactions has often been overlooked. Recent findings, however, show that these resident microbes actively contribute to plant defense mechanisms, rather than merely acting as passive bystanders. This study aimed to document and explore potential interactions within the common bean microbiome assemblages through field investigations in selected locations across the western regions of Kenya. Common bean leaf samples were collected from farmer's fields along motorable roads 3–5 km apart. Shotgun metagenomic analysis identified a diverse range of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, yeast, phytoplasmas, viruses, and bacteriophages, across multiple taxonomic levels—spanning 4 Kingdoms, 136 Phyla, 168 Classes, 360 Orders, 792 Families, 2039 Genera, and 6130 Species—both epiphytic and endophytic, and pathogenic or non-pathogenic. Pseudomonadota consistently showed the highest taxonomic annotation for antimicrobial-resistant organisms, highlighting its central role in resistance across the studied area. The sequences obtained were mapped to the EggNOG, CAZy, and KEGG databases to explore, assign, and predict gene functions. The EggNOG database emphasized the importance of “Replication, recombination, and repair” processes in maintaining genomic stability, along with amino acid transport, energy production, and metabolism. CAZy analysis revealed a significant presence of glycosyltransferases, particularly from GT1 and GT32 families, and noted the role of enzymes like Glycoside Hydrolases in plant defense against pathogens. KEGG pathway analysis underscored the central role of metabolic processes such as energy metabolism, translation, and carbohydrate metabolism. Key pathways linked to plant defense and resilience, including 2-oxocarboxylic acid metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis, were identified. These findings underscore the role of metabolic and enzymatic processes in strengthening plant defenses and stress tolerance while laying the groundwork for multidisciplinary research to advance sustainable agriculture and food safety.",

While HAVD has been defined as a peripheral vascular injury disorders, its comprehensive disease mechanisms—spanning molecular drivers, pathophysiological cascades, and clinically actionable biomarkers remain substantially unelucidated. Our study has used miRNA sequencing (miRNA-seq) to investigate the differential expression of miRNAs in HAVD patients compared to workers exposed to hand-transmitted vibration. In vitro, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) have been utilized to explore the role of miR-100-5p in endothelial cell dysfunction. Our results reveal that 36 miRNAs were upregulated and 2 miRNAs were downregulated in HAVD patients. Notably, miR-100-5p and miR-4735-5p exhibited the most significant differential expression.The area under the curve (AUC) for miR-100-5p in distinguishing hand-transmitted vibration-exposed workers from healthy individuals was 0.9906, while its AUC for identifying HAVD was 0.9922. The combination of those two miRNAs as the diagnostic marker of HAVD showed great potential has higher AUC, with high sensitivity, and specificity. Furthermore, miR-100-5p might mediate the pathology of HAVD by inhibiting vascular cell angiogenesis via VEGFA/VEGFR pathway, which could be regulated by decreased TRIB2 expression and inhibition of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Rice (Oryza sativa L.), a global staple crop, is crucial to food security, particularly in Asia. The Taihu Lake Basin, located in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, is a secondary origin center for rice, with a cultivation history dating back over 8000 years. However, the genetic diversity of traditional rice landraces in this region faces significant threats due to the widespread adoption of high-yielding cultivars. This study aimed to characterize the genetic structure of rice landraces from the Taihu Lake Basin, develop KASP markers for precise identification, and establish a core germplasm collection, using high-throughput resequencing technologies. A total of 114 rice landrace accessions from the Taihu Lake Basin were sampled and analyzed. Population genetic structure analysis revealed seven distinct genetic groups. Utilizing this dataset, a set of 27 kompetitive allele specific PCR (KASP) markers were developed, enabling accurate genotyping and efficient landrace identification. Furthermore, a core germplasm collection was established, representing 99 % of the genetic diversity of the original collection. Overall, this study provides a valuable resource for the conservation and sustainable utilization of rice landraces in the Taihu Lake Basin, supporting future rice breeding programs and ensuring the preservation of genetic resources crucial for crop improvement.",

    "abstract": "Numerous small open reading frames (smORFs) and related smORF-encoded peptides (SEPs) have been identified in model plants. However, a genome-wide overview of smORFs has yet to be established in plants, especially in crops. Here, we predicted millions of novel smORFs in Arabidopsis and 14 commonly cultivated crops by bioinformatic approaches. We found that the smORFs may reflect recurrent polyploidy events and genome rearrangements during evolution, and some smORFs are under strong purifying selection. About 70 % of orthogroups contain SEPs from one species, while 0.1 % of orthogroups contain SEPs from all species. Orthogroup size variation suggests that species-specific features are shaped by factors, including evolutionary relationship, genome size, and genome duplication. DNA repair and translation are major functions of conserved SEPs. Species-specific functions were also observed, such as salt stress responses in Brassica. Our work provides a valuable resource of smORFs and SEPs, offering insights into the understanding of their characteristics.",

The earthworm gut microbiome increased in diversity in a density-dependent manner, while treated soils displayed enhanced microbial richness—with the 80 worms/kg treatment showing the highest diversity (605 genera). Random Forest analysis identified key bacterial genera, and co-occurrence networks pinpointed potential keystone taxa. PICRUSt2 predicted enrichment of pathways for xenobiotic biodegradation, carbohydrate metabolism, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis.

In this study, we systematically identified and evaluated blacklist regions in cattle and pig genomes using the ENCODE pipeline.

    "abstract": "Cholangiocarcinoma is characterized by its high malignancy, frequent recurrence and insensitivity to conventional radiotherapy and chemotherapy. This resistance may be associated with the presence of cells in the G0/G1 arrest phase within the cancer. Cancer cells in the G0/G1 phase are resistant to therapies targeting actively dividing cells, allowing them to evade conventional adjuvant treatments and survive. When conditions become favorable, these quiescent cells can re-enter the cell cycle, proliferate and potentially contribute to cancer recurrence. However, the biomarkers for identifying cells in the G0/G1 arrest phase within cholangiocarcinoma and the molecular mechanisms inducing G0/G1 arrest remain unclear. In our study, we first identified APOC1 as a characteristic gene for G0/G1 phase arrest in cholangiocarcinoma through bulk RNA sequencing (bulkRNA-seq). We then used single-cell RNA sequencing(scRNA-seq) for cell cycle inference and localized the expression peaks of APOC1 to verify its active cell cycle phase. Our experiments demonstrated that APOC1 can induce G0/G1 phase arrest in cholangiocarcinoma cells by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, thereby suppressing cell proliferation, migration and invasion. This suggests that APOC1 may serve as a key regulatory factor and an important biomarker for cells in the G0/G1 phase of cholangiocarcinoma.",

    "title": "METTL14 facilitates the process of sexual reversal via m6A RNA methylation in Pelodiscus sinensis",
    "abstract": "The Chinese soft-shelled turtle (Pelodiscus sinensis, P. sinensis) demonstrates noteworthy sexual dimorphism, where the males grow more rapidly and significantly larger than females under equivalent conditions. Estradiol (E2) administration can catalyze transformation from male to pseudo-female (PF), during which m6A RNA methylation undergoes considerable alterations. Nevertheless, the function of m6A methylation, specifically, the methyltransferase 14, N6-adenosine-methyltransferase non-catalytic subunit gene (METTL14) during this sex reversal process remains unclear. Within this study, we characterized the METTL14 gene, which was predominantly expressed within the ovary and demonstrated notable expression in PF individuals. Interference of METTL14 results in altered expression of methylation-related genes, yielding elevated RSPO1 expression and diminished AMH expression. Administration of E2 and METTL14-RNAi elicits 7994 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) during sexual differentiation, and KEGG enrichment analysis highlighted that METTL14 profoundly affects embryonic development through pathways including steroid hormone biosynthesis, ovarian steroidogenesis, tryptophan metabolism, and Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) indicated that METTL14-RNAi triggers reduced expression of steroid hormone biosynthesis and ovarian steroidogenesis pathways while increasing the PPAR signaling pathway. In conclusion, METTL14-RNAi results in significant up-regulation of RSPO1 and down-regulation of AMH, inducing substantial alterations in pathways associated with hormone and metabolism. These findings propose that METTL14 may play a facilitating role during E2-induced sex reversal in P. sinensis, offering a novel avenue for further exploration into all-male breeding.",

    "abstract": "Field muskmelon (Cucumis melo L. var. agrestis Naud.), a novel oil crop, contains a high amount of lipids in seeds. However, the high-resolution profiles and dynamic regulation of its lipids remain largely unknown. This study identified the lipids and analyzed their dynamic changes using UHPLC-MS/MS. We identified 2533 lipid molecules in the seeds, including 7 categories and 47 sub-classes, with the higher proportions of glycerolipids (41.02 %) and glycerophospholipids (28.11 %). Moreover, the content of glycerolipids was the highest, particularly for triacylglycerol lipid molecules. Additionally, the expression patterns of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) showed a close correlation with lipid accumulation, especially within the plant hormone signaling pathway. Notably, the sufficient supply of 18:1-CoA, coupled with a high expression level of CmFAD2, contributed significantly to the high linoleic acid (68.56 %) content in field muskmelon seeds. Our findings offer insights that could enhance the comprehensive understanding of lipids in field muskmelon, and facilitate the breeding of field muskmelon.",

    "title": "Deep sequencing of Korean Jindo dog reveals evolutionary trajectory of coat color variations",
    "abstract": "The inherent diversity of canines is closely intertwined with the unique color patterns of each dog population. These variations in color patterns are believed to have originated through mutations and selective breeding practices that occurred during and after the domestication of dogs from wolves. To address the significant gaps that persist in comprehending the evolutionary processes that underlie the development of these patterns, we generated and analyzed deep-sequenced genomes of 113 Korean Indigenous Jindo dogs that represent five distinct color patterns to identify the associated mutations in CBD103, ASIP, and MC1R. The degree of linkage disequilibrium and estimated allelic ages consistently indicate that the black-and-tan dogs descend from the first major founding population on Jindo island, compatible with the documented literature. We additionally demonstrate that black-and-tan dogs, in contrast to other color variations within the breed, exhibit a closer genetic affinity to ancient wolves from western Eurasia than those from eastern Eurasia. Lastly, the alleles unique to black-and-tan dogs indicated a pleiotropic effect by significantly decreasing the body size phenotypes compared to non-carriers. Overall, comparisons of whole genome sequences of each coat color population diverged from the same breed provided an unprecedented glimpse into the properties of evolutionary processes maintaining variation in Korean Jindo dog populations.",

    "abstract": "The long-term selection for meat has led to the poor egg production efficiency in broiler. In this study, we analyzed the transcriptional levels of hypothalamus and ovary during the pre-laying (PP) and laying periods (LP) of broiler breeders. By combining these with the levels of reproductive hormones and ovarian metabolism, to reveal the neuroendocrine control mechanism of ovarian development. Results showed that during LP, the number of LYFs, SYFs and WFs, the thickness of the granular cell layer, and the serum LH, FSH, P4 and E2 levels were significantly increased (P < 0.05). A total of 1188 and 2481 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected in hypothalamus and ovary, respectively. 1972 significantly differentially metabolites (DMs) were detected in ovary. In hypothalamus, the expression of neuroendocrine regulatory genes such as TRH, AVT, VIP, and NYB in the Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway regulated the LH and FSH secretion via the HPG axis. In ovary, the promotion of GCs proliferation may occur through the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway, which increased the thickness of the GCs layer. This helped to receive gonadotropin signals and increased P4 and E2 secretion. Meanwhile, the decreased expression levels of ovarian development inhibitory factors in the TGF-beta signaling pathway, including BMP2, BMP4, BMP15 and AMHR2, and the increased expression levels of MMPs, including MMP9, MMP11 and MMP13, may regulate the synthesis of metabolites associated with steroid hormone secretion and ovarian development, such as E2, E2-3S, 7α-OH-DHEA, CHO and AD. These genes and metabolites may play an important role in HPG axis in regulating ovarian development.",

In this study, we analyzed the impact of injected MSCs on the transcriptome in the brains of neuroinflammatory mouse model (NIM) with bioinformatical methods and conducted experimental validation with qPCR and Western blot. The results showed that the expression of extracellular matrix components changed, and the complement cascade was activated in the NIM brains. Injection of MSCs reversed the expression of ECM components and inhibited complement activation. MSCs may promote the improvement of neuronal synaptic function and alter the infiltration of immune cells into the brain. MSCs regulated the PI3K/AKT/Foxo1 signaling pathway.

    "title": "Insights for variant clinical interpretation based on a benchmark of 65 variant effect predictors",
    "abstract": "Single amino acid substitutions in protein sequences are generally harmless, but a certain number of these changes can lead to disease. Accurately predicting the effect of genetic variants is crucial for clinicians as it accelerates the diagnosis of patients with missense variants associated with health problems. Many computational tools have been developed to predict the pathogenicity of genetic variants with various approaches. Analysing the performance of these different computational tools is crucial to provide guidance to both future users and especially clinicians. In this study, a large-scale investigation of 65 tools was conducted. Variants from both clinical and functional contexts were used, incorporating data from the ClinVar database and bibliographic sources. The analysis showed that AlphaMissense often performed very well and was in fact one of the best options among the existing tools. In addition, as expected, meta-predictors perform well on average. Tools using evolutionary information showed the best performance for functional variants. These results also highlighted some heterogeneity in the difficulty of predicting some specific variants while others are always well categorized. Strikingly, the majority of variants from the ClinVar database appear to be easy to predict, while variants from other sources of data are more challenging. This raises questions about the use of ClinVar and the dataset used to validate tools accuracy. In addition, these results show that this variant predictability can be divided into three distinct classes: easy, moderate and hard to predict. We analyzed the parameters leading to these differences and showed that the classes are related to structural and functional information.",

In this study, four heterozygous variants in CLCN2 were found in 10 CAE patients using whole exome sequencing (WES).

Bioinformatics analysis showed that the four variants were probably damaging, and the c.1141C > G (p.Pro381Ala) and c.1885C > T (p.Arg629Cys) variants affected the tertiary structure of the ClC-2 chloride channel. Functional studies showed that the c.1141C > G (p.Pro381Ala) variant significantly reduced the expression of CLCN2 in the plasma membrane, and affected the Cl− currents of ClC-2 chloride channel, indicating that the c.1141C > G (p.Pro381Ala) variant was a loss-of-function mutation. Furthermore, the minor allele frequency (MAF) of the variant was higher than the incidence of CAE.

The role of extracellular cell surface redox-sensitive proteins in redox regulation and intracellular communication has been supported by secretion of oxidoreductases that modulate thiol-disulfide switches. Despite these advances, redox-sensitive targets on the cell surface remain little explored. We established a comprehensive redox proteomic workflow using plasma membrane impermeable thiol labeling where we identified 1159 cell surface and extracellular proteins susceptible to oxidation. Treatment with diamide or urate hydroperoxide (HOOU) resulted in 377 and 12 differentially abundant redox-modulated proteins compared to control. Such proteins represent chaperones, adhesion molecules, vesicle-associated proteins, channels, receptors, cytoskeleton, and others, which may play a relevant role in several signaling pathway. Eleven oxidoreductases were redox-modulated by diamide, including members of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), peroxiredoxin (PRDX), and quiescin sulfhydryl oxidase (QSOX) families, with a particular focus on PDI TMX3 (TMX3), which provides the first evidence of its secretion in endothelial cells.

Through this analysis, we localized LimA1 and Espin to the BC for the first time, suggesting their important role in this compartment, and confirmed the presence of NHE-RF1. Using a targeted protein repression strategy, we identified E cadherin as essential for the initiation of BC formation, unlike other adherens junction components such as N cadherin or α-catenin.

    "title": "Proteomics reveals the role of the EamB transporter from Aeromonas hydrophila LP-2 in biofilm formation",
    "abstract": "Biofilms play a pivotal role in the survival and persistence of microorganisms, endowing them with heightened resistance to environmental stressors and antimicrobial agents. The EamB protein, which encodes an inner membrane transporter, acted as a negative regulator of biofilm formation, and the gene eamB deletion in the pathogen Aeromonas hydrophila LP-2 resulted in a significant increase in biofilm formation. Proteomic analysis revealed a total of 616 differentially abundant proteins between the ΔeamB and wild-type (WT) strains, with 308 downregulated and 308 upregulated. RT-qPCR was employed to verify the stability and accuracy of the proteomics data. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that EamB is involved in critical bacterial biological processes, including flagellar assembly, amino acid metabolism, and fatty acid degradation. Biofilm formation assays further revealed that supplementation with exogenous lysine significantly inhibited biofilm formation in the ΔeamB strain, conversely, exogenous cysteine and O-acetylserine obviously increased biofilm formation in the ΔeamB strain. These findings demonstrated that EamB may modulate bacterial biofilm formation in A. hydrophila through the regulation of amino acid metabolism. This finding provides novel insights into the regulatory mechanism underlying biofilm formation and highlights potential targets for the development of future antibacterial strategies.",

    "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy is at the forefront of the field of cell immunotherapy. In this study, we generated an anti-CD19 CAR-Jurkat T cell line using a locally produced second-generation anti-CD19 CAR construct, which allowed us to analyse early proteomic changes that are crucial for comprehending the signalling pathways and mechanism of action of this CAR-T cell. SILAC-heavy tagged Raji B-cells and anti-CD19 CAR-Jurkat T-cells were co-cultured for ten minutes. The proteomic profiles were acquired via DIA methodology on the Orbitrap Astral LC-MS/MS platform. The proteome was extensively covered, resulting in about 8800 protein identifications at 1 % FDR. The effector CAR-Jurkat cells showed proteomic changes involving antigen presentation by CD74. The target Raji B-cells exhibited more significant alterations. Effector proteins, namely CD247, CD28, DAP, LCK, p38 MAPK, and CASP3, were validated, as they have critical roles in antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and apoptosis. Pharmacological inhibition of LCK using Dasatinib further suggested its pivotal role in early CAR-T signalling. This study led us to identify proteins that function as molecular effectors of anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapy during the initial phases of CAR-T-target cell engagement, advancing our knowledge of the mechanism and signalling pathways that will support CAR-T cell development.",

In this study, chickpea seeds were aged at 45 °C and 85 % humidity for 4 days, which affected both seeds' viability and vigor. Comparative biochemical analyses showed a higher production of ROS and membrane damage in the aged seeds. Comparative proteomics and metabolomics analyses of seeds were conducted using Easy-nLC LC-MS/MS and GC–MS techniques. This examination identified 2605 proteins, 17654 peptides, and 68 metabolites between the control and aged seeds. A total of 118 statistically significant proteins were identified, with 98 proteins exhibiting differential abundance in response to the aging treatment. The in-silico functional and subcellular analysis revealed that these proteins and metabolites are related to germination, desiccation tolerance, phytohormones, fatty acid, amino acid metabolism, carbon assimilation pathways, and exhibited several locations inside the cell.The relative expression of 8 selected genes was verified using qRT-PCR to check the pattern with proteomics results. Temperature-induced lipocalin (CaTIL) is a protective protein that stabilizes the membrane and provides tolerance to aging, and was selected for molecular characterization.

    "abstract": "Cytokinins are well-known for their multifaceted roles in fine-tuning the plant growth and development during abiotic stresses in plants. An optimized concentration of cytokinins is essential to positively-influence a range of stress-dependent signaling pathways. Our study focuses on how the alteration in cytokinin levels, post CPPU (N-2-(chloro-4-pyridyl)-N-phenyl urea) application, influences the protein components of drought susceptible rice cultivar, PTT1 (Pathumthani1), under water deficit stress. The proteome was investigated by shotgun proteomics and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) at tillering and grain-filling stages of rice. The results indicated that the application of CPPU had an antagonistic effect of on the biosynthesis and signaling of ABA. Drought-stressed rice plants without CPPU treatment revealed enhanced abundance of negative regulator proteins of cytokinin signaling (ORR12 and ORR21) and cytokinin dehydrogenases (CKX2 and CKX3) which are antagonistic to cytokinin responses. By contrast, CPPU treated rice plants had reduced abundance of proteins implicated in ABA biosynthesis and signaling (ZEP, NCED4, PYL9, OSK1/SnRK1A, OSK4/SnRK1B and ABIL5) but showed greater abundance proteins implicated in cytokinin signaling and responses. Further, CPPU treatment induced the abundance of some proteins implicated in maintaining the osmotic balance. The results unravel the antagonistic nature of interaction between two major phytohormones, ABA and cytokinin.",

    "abstract": "Soil salinity is a major abiotic stress that limits global crop production and food security. It is necessary to explore the mechanisms of salt stress tolerance in order to cultivate high-quality salt-tolerant varieties. Sugar beet M14 line exhibits capability of salt stress tolerance. Here we conducted a phosphoproteomic study of the sugar beet M14 roots treated with 200 mM and 400 mM NaCl. Using phosphopeptide enrichment and LC-MS/MS based phosphoproteomics techniques, 1427 differential abundant phosphoproteins (DAPPs) and 983 unique phosphoproteins were identified under 200 mM NaCl. 1234 DAPPs and 769 unique phosphopeptides were identified under 400 mM NaCl. The two datasets were significantly enriched for terms associated with protein kinases and transcription factors. Meanwhile, the biological pathways enriched between 200 mM and 400 mM NaCl containing signaling pathways, metabolism and transport were prominently represented, suggesting that distinct signaling cascades may converge in key biological processes (e.g., glycolysis, transport and reactive oxygen metabolism) to mediate the salt stress response and tolerance. Furthermore, unlike the DAPPs enriched in sugar beet M14 leaves, the DAPPs enriched in roots specifically participated in the plant-pathogen interaction and prenyltransferase pathways.Significance: Sugar beet is an important sugar-producing crop, and its roots are the primary organ usually affected by salt stress. However, the phosphoproteomics of sugar beet M14 roots under salt stress remains unclear. This study emphasizes the changes in the phosphorylation level of sugar beet M14 roots proteins under different salt concentrations. We analyzed the similarities and differences in function and participating pathways of the DAPPs and unique phosphoproteins obtained at different salt stresses. These findings not only provide important insights into the mechanisms mediated by phosphorylation modification in sugar beet M14 response to salt stress, but also will inform efforts toward improving crop yield and quality.",

    "title": "Potential use of serum microvesicle indicators to distinguish different types of drug-induced liver injury",
    "abstract": "Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) may occur after the combination therapy of multiple drugs, which makes it difficult to identify the causative drug for liver injury in epidemiological research and clinical practice. Scutellaria baicalensis (SB), a widely used herb in traditional Chinese medicine, has been reported to cause liver injury when combined with antibiotics. However, diagnosing SB-drug induced liver injury (SB-DILI) and its distinction from antibiotic-induced DILI (AILI) is one of the significant challenges in modern clinical practice. There are still no effective indicators to distinguish between SB-DILI and AILI. Therefore, to discover and validate highly relevant indicators, we implemented a mass spectrometry workflow using label-free quantitative proteomics and Parallel Reaction Monitoring (PRM) in serum microvesicles (MVs) from 29 patients with SB-DILI, 28 patients with AILI, and 33 healthy volunteers (HVs). The results showed that a combined analysis of lysozyme (LYZ), component 4-binding protein α (C4BPA), and complement component 1r (C1R) from serum MVs yielded an area under the curve (AUC) ≥ 0.95, indicating that the combination analysis nearly fully distinguished between SB-DILI and AILI in these cohorts. This study underscores the potential of circulating MV indicators in differentiating between SB-DILI and AILI, offering significant implications for clinical diagnosis and therapeutic approaches for DILI.",

    "abstract": "Periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the tooth-supporting structures, is a key indicator of oral health in palaeopathology. While poor oral hygiene, systemic diseases, and genetics are well-established contributors, the dietary impact has often been underestimated. Clinical studies, however, link diets high in fermentable carbohydrates and meat to inflammation. We investigated periodontal disease by analyzing interdental septa in 63 individuals from elite and non-elite groups in pre-Roman Italy (7th–4th centuries BCE), a period of social stratification, intensified agriculture, and increased cereal consumption. Macroscopic analysis was combined with proteomics of dental calculus from 33 individuals. Of the 1890 septa considered, 23 % displayed signs of periodontitis, with significantly higher rates in males. Prevalence increased with age in both sexes. Proteomic findings identified Porphyromonas gingivalis, a key periodontal pathogen, in 10 of 19 well-preserved dental calculus samples. While plaque accumulation is the main trigger for periodontitis, our findings highlight the dietary role in disease susceptibility. Carbohydrate-rich foods adhere to teeth and nourish bacteria, worsening periodontal conditions. At the same time, greater access to animal protein, particularly among emerging elites, may have contributed to inflammation. We propose that a proinflammatory diet may have been a major contributor to the proliferation of pathogenic oral microbiota.",

However, the mechanisms underlying the development of E. multilocularis cysts in different tissues remain unclear. In this study, we compared the proteomic profiles of E. multilocularis cysts derived from mice intraperitoneally and subcutaneously infected with PSCs at 30 days post-infection, prior to the development of mature PSCs. Proteomic analysis identified 284 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in SCs compared to ICs, with 147 upregulated DEPs and 137 downregulated DEPs. Enzymatic proteins involved in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism were predominantly upregulated in SCs compared to ICs, whereas proteins associated with protein folding, sorting, a degradation were downregulated. Western blotting analysis confirmed that phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) were upregulated, whereas transitional endoplasmic reticulum ATPase (TER ATPase) was downregulated in SCs compared to ICs. The identified DEPs may play crucial roles in shaping the unique characteristics of E. multilocularis cysts.

Further proteomic analysis of midgut gland extracts confirmed the identity of different-class peptidases, as well as additional isoforms not previously reported, and changes in their relative abundance. Trypsins and chymotrypsins were the predominantly active peptidases throughout the digestion process. Cathepsin D was active during the preprandial time and 3 h after ingestion, whereas a metallopeptidase showed activity at preprandial time and 1 h postprandial. Additional trypsin isoforms of varying abundances were confirmed, while chymotrypsins and cathepsin L increased significantly, peaking 3 h postprandial.

Understanding the biological processes underlying the different stroke subtypes could help improve acute stroke care and patient outcomes. Plasma-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as promising tools for investigating these processes through their unique cargo.Therefore, we aimed at exploring the protein content of plasma-derived EVs in a cohort composed of patients with hemorrhagic stroke (n = 10), ischemic stroke with large-vessel occlusion (LVO) (n = 10) and without LVO (n = 10), transient ischemic attack (n = 10), stroke mimics (n = 10) and healthy controls (n = 10). EVs were isolated by size exclusion chromatography from 150 μL of plasma. Characterization was performed by transmission electron microscopy, western blotting and nanoparticle tracking analysis, and confirmed an efficient EV enrichment. Proteomics analysis was conducted using data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry and a supervised partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model was applied on proteomics data.The PLS-DA model successfully distinguished healthy controls, severe stroke subtypes (LVO ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke), and non LVO ischemic stroke, identifying key proteins influencing these patterns.

However, their small fragment size makes eggshells difficult to accurately identify using traditional methods. Recent mass spectrometry advances have significantly enhanced eggshell species identification in archaeological research, but their success remains limited. For example, Anser cygnoides and Anser anser eggshells cannot yet be reliably distinguished. This paleoproteomic study uses Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry and Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry to identify by proteotyping the species of eggshells from the Xitou site in China. We established a series of peptide markers and amino acid variants to distinguish A. cygnoides from A. anser, and with this method attribute three Xitou eggshell specimens to the graylag goose. Carbon isotope analysis and shell thickness measurements were conducted to understand the domestication of the geese associated with these eggshells. The isotope results indicate that these geese primarily ate C3 plants, and shell thickness results suggest they were possibly domesticated. These findings firstly provide direct molecular evidence of possibly domesticated graylag geese in China and offer new insights into poultry domestication and cultural practices.",

    "title": "Unraveling the proteomic landscape of red-fleshed apples to identify regulators of anthocyanin accumulation",
    "abstract": "Anthocyanins are colorful plant pigments with antioxidant properties, and a diet rich in these flavonoids bears health benefits. Therefore, a strong anthocyanin accumulation in edible plant parts is of significant interest, and in Malus domestica, the domesticated apple, certain red-fleshed apple varieties exhibit this trait. Enhanced anthocyanin accumulation in the flesh of apple fruits is attributed to the hyperactivation of the MYB transcription factor MdMYB10, which acts as a key regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis by inducing the expression of multiple biosynthetic genes. While several studies have explored the underlying genetic mutations and resulting transcriptome changes, there is a lack of research on proteome alterations that cause the red-fleshed apple phenotype. To address this gap, a mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach was employed. Comparative proteomics identified differentially abundant proteins in young and mature fruits of the red-fleshed ‘Bay13645’ variety compared to the white-fleshed ‘Gala’. Whereas several MYB transcription factors were enriched during early fruit development, they were no longer among the hyper-abundant proteins in ripe fruits of the red-fleshed genotype. In contrast, anthocyanin biosynthetic enzymes were enriched more strongly in ripe fruits of the red-fleshed cultivar, supporting previous results which had indicated developmental stage-specific differences in the control of the pigmentation process. The proteomic approach also identified novel regulatory factors and enzymes that may contribute to the red-fleshed apple phenotype, including a BAHD acyltransferase, Mal d proteins, and transcription factors of diverse families, and their potential relevance for the exhibition of this trait is discussed.",

    "title": "Cross and unique stress adaptation strategies of the polyextremophile Natranaerobius thermophilus to individual high salt, alkaline pH, and elevated temperature",
    "abstract": "N. thermophilus is the first true anaerobic halophilic alkalithermophile. It employs a unique dual mechanism for hypersaline adaptation, utilizing both “compatible solutes” and “salt in” strategies. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its responses to alkaline pH and thermal stress remain poorly characterized. An iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics analysis revealed that N. thermophilus used a cross and unique adaptation strategies to three individual extreme stresses. This study fills gaps by elucidating previously unexplored alkaline-specific regulatory processes. It also provides the first comprehensive analysis of its thermal adaptation mechanisms. In response to high-salt and alkaline stress, the organism shifts its metabolism toward glycolysis and pyruvate-derived acetate synthesis, helping to meet increased ATP demands. Heat shock proteins are up-regulated during both alkaline and thermal adaptations, reflecting the “No free lunch” principle. Alkaline pH uniquely induces DNA repair proteins and S-adenosylmethionine biosynthesis enzymes, promoting genomic stability in proton-deficient environments. Besides, the compact genome and the positive correlation between GC content with growth temperature may be also a lineage-specific thermal adaptation of the halophilic and alkalithermophilic order Natranaerobiales. These findings illuminate the layered adaptation strategies that help address cross-stress challenges. Meanwhile, stress-specific reconfigurations enhance flexibility for survival in individual extremes. This work provides novel insights into the survival mechanisms of polyextremophiles, as well as advancing their potential biotechnological applications.",

    "abstract": "The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway plays a crucial role in regulating cellular growth and proliferation. While extensively studied in mammals, the phosphorylation dynamics of this pathway in non-mammalian model organisms remain largely unexplored, often due to the scarcity of suitable antibodies to measure (phosphorylated) proteins of interest. To address this gap, we developed an antibody-independent targeted phosphoproteomics method applying liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to quantify the abundance and phosphorylation levels of mTOR pathway-related proteins in zebrafish (Danio rerio), using the permanent cell line PAC2 as a model system. With optimized sample processing and data analysis strategies, we could successfully quantify 10 endogenous phosphosites and 15 endogenous proteins at different cell culture growth phases, revealing complex phosphorylation dynamics for both the upstream regulators (e.g., AKT, AMPK) and downstream effectors (e.g., eIF4EBP1, RPS6) of the mTOR pathway, which reflected transition from exponential growth to stationary subsistence. Our findings confirm the overall similarity of the mTOR pathway structure and functionality between zebrafish and mammals. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the high potential of the LC-MS/MS-based analytical approaches for studying phosphorylation-governed signalling in diverse organisms of interest, thus paving the way for further investigations in comparative physiology and toxicology across species.",

This study integrates proteomic and transcriptomic analyses to investigate the role of miR-181a-5p in OSCC pathogenesis using CRISPR/Cas9-generated whole-body knockout (KO) mice. By inducing OSCC with the chemical carcinogen 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO), we identified significant dysregulation of lipid metabolism-associated proteins and tumor regulators in miR-181a-5p-KO tumors compared to wild-type controls. Quantitative proteomics revealed enrichment of the PPAR signaling pathway, with 12 key genes upregulated in KO mice, mechanistically linking miR-181a-5p deficiency to enhanced lipid droplet biogenesis and immunosuppressive microenvironments. Serum biomarker validation demonstrated elevated Cyfra21–1, SCC-Ag, and ISG20 levels in KO mice, correlating with tumor aggressiveness and radioresistance. Multi-omics integration further identified a diagnostic-prognostic protein signature with 89 % specificity for miR-181a-5p-deficient OSCC subtypes. These findings establish miR-181a-5p as a master regulator of PPAR-mediated metabolic reprogramming and immune evasion, offering novel proteome-driven insights into therapeutic targeting of lipid metabolism and biomarker discovery in OSCC.",

    "abstract": "Heat stress significantly reduces canola seed production during the post-pollination stages. This study explored changes in the proteome of flowers on the main stem of three Brassica napus cultivars exposed to transient heat stress after pollination. Flowers at the 2nd to 5th reproductive nodes on the main stem were collected on days 0, 1, 3 and 6 of heat stress and control treatments. The three cultivars, Alku, AV-Ruby, and YM11, exhibited varying degrees of heat sensitivity and resilience based on seed production in pods at these reproductive nodes. The seed yield per pod under heat stress was 75.3 % of the control in Alku and 64.2 % in YM11. However, AV-Ruby retained 93.5 % of its seed yield under heat stress, from which we conclude AV-Ruby was more resilient to heat stress during the post-pollination stage than Alku or YM11. There were 474 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) identified across all cultivars and time points. Among the DAPs, two HSP20-like chaperones (A0A078I8F7, A0A078JBL3) and one HSP-related protein (A0A078JJT8) were consistently highly abundant under heat and were strong candidates as heat responsive proteins. Pathways related to maintaining membrane integrity were specifically enriched in AV-Ruby, and deserve further study for their potential involvement in heat tolerance.",

    "abstract": "Radiation-induced rectal injury (RRI) affects perioperative treatment and the postoperative quality of life in patients with rectal cancer undergoing radiotherapy. This study aimed to clarify the molecular mechanisms of RRI and identify potential therapeutic targets. Hematoxylin-eosin and Masson's staining were utilized to evaluate RRI. Initially, 16 rectal samples were examined using data-independent acquisition proteomics to identify the differentially abundant proteins (DAPs). Subsequently, parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) was employed to validate DAP expression. Furthermore, DAP levels were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 118 patients with rectal cancer. Pathologic examination revealed manifestations of RRI in rectal samples. A total of 1391 DAPs were identified, with 619 upregulated and 772 downregulated. Functional annotation revealed that these proteins are primarily involved in regulating actin cytoskeleton, metabolic pathways, and immune pathways. Enrichment analysis indicated significant enrichment of DAPs in pathways, including macrophage chemotaxis, neutrophil extracellular traps, and lipid metabolism. The expression of significantly upregulated DAPs (LBP, ITIH4, SERPINA3, FN1, PLG, HRG, FGA, and SAA1) in the relevant pathway was validated using PRM. ELISA revealed that the SAA1 level in the RRI group was significantly high. In conclusion, our study provides a proteomic profile of RRI, identifying biological markers and potential molecular regulatory mechanisms.",

We highlighted the abundance of numerous tissue-specific proteins, exemplified by Synapsin-1 in brain, Uncoupling protein 1 in brown fat, and Zona pellucida proteins in reproductive tissues. Gene ontologies and pathway analyses of the most relatively abundant proteins in each tissue revealed enrichment patterns consistent with known physiological functions. For instance, brain tissue showed enrichment for synaptic components and neurotransmission processes, while liver tissue was enriched for metabolic pathways.

Scrapings were collected by two experimenters, who each handled three of the six segments per pig. Both experimenters were given the exact same instructions for performing the mucosal scrapings. Samples were then randomized and processed in two separate groups on different days to examine batch effects. Protein extraction and digestion was carried out using Midi S-Traps (ProtiFi) and peptides were analyzed by DIA-MS. Data processing and statistical analysis were performed using DIA-NN and RStudio. Our analyses revealed no significant experimenter effects, but we observed small batch effects across datasets.

The effect of APT1 deletion on the fungal proteome is unknown, limiting the understanding of its functions in physiology. The APT gene family also includes APT2, whose functions in C. neoformans are virtually unknown. We investigated the impact of APT1 and APT2 deletion on EV formation in C. neoformans. The absence of Apt1, but not Apt2, led to a decreased concentration of the polysaccharide glucuronoxylomannan in EVs. We characterized the EV and cellular proteomes of C. neoformans mutants lacking APT1 and APT2, comparing them to the proteomes of wild-type (WT) cells. Paired comparisons revealed that WT and mutant EVs shared a significant part of their cargo but showed several strain-specific molecules and exhibited major differences in the abundance of various proteins. Conversely, the cellular proteomes of both mutants largely overlapped with WT (95.4 % shared proteins. Protein network analyses highlighted mutant-specific shifts: the apt1Δ/apt2Δ proteomes converged on secondary metabolite biosynthesis and RNA metabolism clusters, diverging from the predominance of translation in WT cells. These findings establish APT1 and APT2 as key regulators of EV composition in C. neoformans.",

While changes in the gut microbiome composition were observed in response to IBD therapy using biologics, studies elucidating human and microbial proteins and pathways in dependence on therapy success are sparse. Fecal samples of a cohort of IBD patients were collected before and after 14 weeks of treatment with three different biologics. Clinical disease activity scores were used to determine the clinical response and remission. Fecal metaproteomes of remitting patients (n = 12) and of non-remitting patients (n = 12) were compared before treatment and changes within both groups were assessed over sampling time to identify functional changes and potential human and microbial biomarkers. The abundance of proteins associated with neutrophilic granulocytes, and immunoglobulins significantly decreased in remitting patients. There were changes in pathways of microbial metabolism in samples from patients with remission after therapy, including an increased butyrate fermentation. Distinct changes of proteins related to gut inflammation and gut microbiome metabolism showed whether IBD remission was achieved or not.

    "abstract": "Maize somatic embryogenesis process depends on explant characteristics and genotype. The relationship between explant developmental timing and embryogenic potential of derived tissues is still poorly understood. The present work explored the adjustments of transcriptomes and proteomes from explants with contrasting embryogenic potential – immature and mature zygotic embryos from the Tuxpeño VS-535 genotype – during callus induction. Differentially accumulated transcripts and proteins were represented by oxidation/reduction, stress response, and metabolic process adjustments during the dedifferentiation of both explants. However, the explant with high embryogenic potential and derived callus displayed more significant enrichment in cell proliferation and plant hormone signal transduction pathways. Between the differentially accumulated proteins, it is of notice a significantly higher enrichment of catabolic and anoxia processes in non-embryogenic as opposed to anabolic and oxidation-reduction processes in the embryogenic callus induction. Transcription factors such as Auxin Response Factors (ARFs), signal transduction (Homeobox; HB), and embryogenesis-related AP2-EREB mRNAs characterized the immature embryos. Activator and repressor ARFs substantially differed at the early stages of callus induction between immature and mature embryo explants. The overall analysis of these findings helps to understand the molecular basis of gene expression regulation during callus dedifferentiation and auxin responses from maize explants with contrasting embryogenic potential.",

    "title": "Comparative proteomics uncovers vital molecular players of central nervous system leukemia among Mexican pediatric patients",
    "abstract": "Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common pediatric hematologic malignancy. The leukemic cells start in the bone marrow and spread to other vital organs and tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS). Hispanic males are the community with the highest incidence of ALL. Unfortunately, there is limited information on the molecular signatures of leukemic cell infiltration into the CNS, which marks the progression from ALL to central nervous system leukemia (CNSL). To address this knowledge gap, we performed a label-free shotgun proteomics between the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with ALL compared to those with confirmed CNSL. We were able to identify 619 proteins, including 340 proteins that had not been reported prevously in the CSF of subjects with CNSL. The major features associated with CNSL included the over-accumulation of cell-adhesion proteins such as L-selectin and several cadherin proteins, along with the modulation of enzymes associated with protein glycosylation, which may provide the appropriate conditions for leukemic cell infiltration into the CNS. The over-accumulation of proteins associated with ROS scavenging processes reveals hypoxic and redox homeostasis microenvironment conditions that favors ALL progression to CNSL. The further characterization of key differential proteins will be essential for establishing reliable molecular markers for CSNL.",

    "abstract": "Intensity-based absolute quantification (iBAQ) is essential in proteomics as it allows for the assessment of a protein's absolute abundance in various samples or conditions. However, the computation of these values for increasingly large-scale and high-throughput experiments, such as those using DIA, TMT, or LFQ workflows, poses significant challenges in scalability and reproducibility. Here, we present ibaqpy (https://github.com/bigbio/ibaqpy), a Python package designed to compute iBAQ values efficiently for experiments of any scale. Ibaqpy leverages the Sample and Data Relationship Format (SDRF) metadata standard to incorporate experimental metadata into the quantification workflow. This allows for automatic normalization and batch correction while accounting for key aspects of the experimental design, such as technical and biological replicates, fractionation strategies, and sample conditions. Designed for large-scale proteomics datasets, ibaqpy can also recompute iBAQ values for existing experiments when an SDRF is available. We showcased ibaqpy's capabilities by reanalyzing 17 public proteomics datasets from ProteomeXchange, covering HeLa cell lines with 4921 samples and 5766 MS runs, quantifying a total of 11,014 proteins. In our reanalysis, ibaqpy is a key component in automating reproducible quantification, reducing manual effort and making quantitative proteomics more accessible while supporting FAIR principles for data reuse.",

    "abstract": "Oudemansiella raphanipes can degrade lignocellulose-rich biomass, especially agricultural residues. However, its substrate utilization and degradation mechanisms remain poorly understood. To explore this, we cultured O. raphanipes mycelium in Kirk's liquid medium supplemented with eight distinct substrates and conducted studies on extracellular enzyme activities and secretome analysis. A total of 905 secreted proteins were identified, with the cornstalk group having the highest counts. Carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) were the predominant type (32.8–48.9 %), followed by oxidoreductases (2.8 %–13.3 %), while lipase and phosphatase were minor categories. Functional annotation of the secreted proteins comprehensively revealed their diversity in various biological processes. Among the 340 secreted proteins with Enzyme Commission codes, (Methyl)glyoxal oxidase, chitinase, and β-glucosidase were most prominent. Bran, cottonseed hulls, corncobs, and the mixture promoted mycelium growth and conserved CAZymes expression patterns. In contrast, sawdust, corn steep liquor, and cornstalk induced divergent secretome profiles. Sawdust led to a higher proportion of hemicellulose- and lignin-degrading enzymes. Corn steep liquor induced relatively high activities and abundances of laccase and MnP, while cornstalk induced a broad spectrum of oxidoreductases, lipases, and protease & peptidases. In addition, redundancy analysis further indicated that the extracellular enzyme activities (notably laccase, MnP, and xylanase) induced by different substrates significantly impacted the secretome.",

    "abstract": "Pseudorabies virus (PRV) can infect most mammals and has caused significant economic losses in global pig production. The emergence of new mutants significantly reduces the protective effect of vaccination, indicating an urgent need for the development of specific therapeutic agents against PRV infection. In this study, we analyzed the changes in the cellular proteome after PRV infection in resveratrol-treated PK-15 cells using TMT quantitative proteomics combined with LC-MS/MS. The results identified the differential proteins osteopontin (iOPN) and interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAP), which have significant biological implications. The regulation of OPN-IL-1β signaling by PRV infection was further studied through the OPN-ERK/JNK-IL-1β signaling axis. The transcriptional levels of OPN, C-JUN, IL-1RAP, and IL-1β, along with the protein levels of ERK, JNK, C-Jun, and their phosphorylated forms at 8, 12, and 16 h post-infection, were determined. The results showed that PRV infection inhibited the activation of this signaling axis, which was upregulated by resveratrol treatment. Down-regulation of OPN by siRNA increased PRV proliferation and inhibited the activation of the signaling axis, which was antagonized by resveratrol treatment. In PRV-infected mice, resveratrol treatment produced the same changes observed in vitro. The present study demonstrated that resveratrol can promote innate immune responses by regulating the OPN-ERK/JNK-IL-1β signaling axis, thereby activating host antiviral defenses against PRV infection.",

    "title": "Multi-organ proteome reveals different nursing ability between two honeybee srocks",
    "abstract": "High royal jelly production is an adaptive reproductive investment syndrome in honey bees that enhances their nursing ability to queen bee larvae. However, the biological basis of this reproduction investment at the multi-organ level remains elusive. In this study, proteome across 11 organs of two bee stocks: high royal jelly production bees (RJBs) and Italian bees (ITBs) was compared. Our analysis revealed significant differences in protein expression profiles in brain, fat body, mandibular gland, and Malpighian tubule, highlighting their crucial roles in regulating royal jelly secretion in RJBs. The increased energy turnover, protein synthesis, and lipid synthesis observed in RJBs compared to ITBs highlight their enhanced metabolic activity, which is essential for the robust secretion of royal jelly in RJBs. The elevated abundance of major royal jelly proteins (MRJPs), hexamerins, and vitellogenin suggests their critical contributions to the nutritional and material requirement necessary for royal jelly secretion. Furthermore, the high level of vitellogenin and juvenile hormone esterase may suppress juvenile hormones, which contribute to a strong royal jelly secretion and sensitivity of RJBs to larval pheromones relative to ITBs. This comprehensive dataset contributes to a better understanding of nursing behavior and reproductive investment in honey bees.Significiance.The royal jelly secretion syndrome is a colony level social trait dominated by the intricate interplay of multiple organs. However, previous studies have primarily focused on individual organs. In this study, the proteome of 11 organs was compared between high royal jelly production bees (RJBs) and Italian bees (ITBs) to provide knowledge on how multiple organs cooperate to boost the elevated royal jelly production by RJBs. Nutrition supply was sufficient at multiple organs of RJBs when compared to ITBs, indicating that nutrition plays an essential role in boosting energy metabolism, protein and lipid synthesis, and directly contributes to the amount of royal jelly secretion. The high level of secretion of storage proteins, such as MRJPs, hex, and vitellogenin, provides sufficient nutrition and material for royal jelly secretion. Moreover, the higher levels of vitellogenin and juvenile hormone esterase may suppress juvenile hormone synthesis, and contributing to stronger sense of RJBs to larval pheromone relative to ITBs. This suggests that nutrition can influence the hormone levels and sensory abilities of RJBs nurse bees to promote their royal jelly secretion ability. The reported data provide insights into the systematic regulation strategy of honeybee nursing behavior and reproductive investment.",

In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the overall patterns of three lysine acylation in S. aureus including acetylation, succinylation, and malonylation. Using mass spectrometry, we identified 1249 acetylated, 871 succinylated, and 67 malonylated sites. Bioinformatic analysis furtherly revealed that both lysine acetylation and succinylation exhibited a preferential association with glutamate residues near the modified lysine positions. Pathway enrichment showed that modified substrates were associated with ribosomes and metabolic functions. Additional functional exploration showed that lysine succinylation significantly regulates the enzymatic activity of Glutamyl-tRNA amidotransferase and Carbamoyl phosphate synthase. In conclusion, our study enhanced the comprehension of lysine succinylation in S. aureus and highlights potential targets related to its pathogenicity at the post-translational modification level.",

    "abstract": "Cold stress poses a significant challenge to pig farming in northern China, leading to reduced productivity and, in severe cases, even mortality. However, the mechanisms underlying cold resistance in pigs are not well understood. To explore the genetic mechanism of cold resistance in pigs under low-temperature conditions, the cold-tolerant Hezuo pig was selected as a model. DIA proteomics analysis was performed on liver tissues from Hezuo pigs after 24 h of exposure to low-temperature treatments. The results showed that approximately 149 differential abundance proteins (DAPs) were detected (95 up-regulated and 54 down-regulated). GO analysis showed that these DAPs were mainly associated with lipid metabolism, vesicle fusion, and membrane function. KEGG analysis showed that these DAPs were primarily enriched in lipid metabolism-related pathways such as cholesterol metabolism and vitamin digestion and absorption. Comprehensive analysis identified APOA4, APOA2, SREBF2, ATP23, STX2, USO1, ETFA, RAB11FIP1, ETNPPL, and SGMS1 as potential key proteins involved in cold resistance mechanisms. The mRNA expression of the genes for two key candidate proteins (APOA4 and SREBF2), which are involved in lipid metabolism, was analyzed using qRT-PCR, revealing a significant up-regulation after low-temperature treatment. These findings provide significant insights into the mechanisms of cold resistance in animals and may serve as candidate markers for further studies on cold tolerance.",

    "abstract": "Developing dietary formulations for aquaculture that meet nutritional requirements is essential to production, as nutrition is key for fish growth and health. However, novel dietary formulations may induce malnutrition, which is complex to evaluate and often requires animal sacrifice. Therefore, finding reliable non-lethal biomarkers to diagnose malnutrition in fish is important. This study aimed to obtain vital information on potential non-lethal biomarkers from blood plasma and skin mucus to assess the fish's nutritional status using meagre (Argyrosomus regius) juveniles. For that purpose, a nutritional challenge was performed with fish fed a fish meal (FM) and fish-oil (FO) based control diet (55.1 % FM; 11 % FO, CTRL), a challenging diet (15 % FM; 7 % FO, CD), and a highly challenging diet (5 % FM; 5 % FO, ED), which, despite being nutritionally complete, may pose digestive and physiological challenges to carnivorous species. Diets significantly affected blood parameters, except for leukocyte counts, peroxidase activity, and immunoglobulin levels. Overall, blood parameters showed potential as non-lethal biomarkers to accurately identify signs of malnutrition. Meagre's plasma and skin mucus proteomes provided crucial information on the species' reaction to malnutrition, and 29 proteins connected to various physiological functions such as metabolism, development and immunity showed potential as non-lethal biomarkers.",

The annelid Sternaspidae is an important group of phosphate-mineralizing organisms, known for its unique amorphous phosphate ventro-caudal shield. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of their phosphate shields remain unclear. In this study, we identified shield matrix proteins (ShiMPs) from Sternaspis chinensis (SC group with hard shield) and Sternaspis liui syn (SL group with soft shield) using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). A total of 1360 ShiMPs were identified, with 237 differentially expressed proteins between the two morphologies. The differential expression of collagen, extracellular matrix proteins with new EGF-VWA domains, and calcium-binding proteins in different morphological shields suggested that they may be associated with the variation in shield phenotypes. Furthermore, the phenoloxidase innate immune cascade pathway was found to be upregulated in the SL group. Compared with other biomineral proteins, sternaspid shields lacked typical chitin-related proteins but were rich in collagen proteins containing EGF domains, suggesting that collagen may serve as a scaffold for amorphous phosphate deposition. This study provided a molecular dataset for the formation of sternaspid shields and revealed the molecular regulatory features of different shield morphologies.",

    "abstract": "Microalgae are often called “green factories” because they can perform photosynthesis, converting sunlight into biomass and high-value metabolites. Nitrogen concentration is a critical factor influencing protein accumulation. Unfortunately, nitrogen deprivation often negatively impacts biomass production. Understanding the relationship between nitrogen concentration and protein accumulation is crucial for harnessing the potential of microalgae in various industries and addressing environmental challenges. Here, we quantitatively compared the proteomic profiles of Chaetoceros muelleri diatom, grown in two Nitrogen-deficient conditions and control treatment by employing a Tandem Mass Tag-based quantitative proteomic approach. Proteins involved in photosynthesis were differentially accumulated under moderately nitrogen-deficient conditions. In contrast, proteins involved in cell signaling and protection mechanisms were differentially accumulated under severely nitrogen-limited conditions. Proteins associated with nitrogen metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and protein biosynthesis were differentially decreased in severely nitrogen-limited conditions, indicating differential response mechanisms of C. muelleri to varying nitrogen conditions. Our results show that C. muelleri employs distinct strategies in response to nitrogen limitation. These results provide valuable insights into the adaptive strategies of C. muelleri under nitrogen limitation, offering potential applications in optimizing microalgal cultures for the enhanced production of target metabolites in industrial bioreactors.",

    "title": "Spatial and development responses in the wheat leaf highlight the loss of chloroplast protein homeostasis during salt stress",
    "abstract": "Salinity stress in wheat affects physiological and biochemical parameters in tissues that alter plant development and ultimately lower crop yield. Shoot tissues can accumulate high concentrations of sodium over time through the transpiration stream coming from the roots. This imposes physiological responses that align salt effects with the basipetal developmental gradient of the monocot leaf. The role of metabolic processes in generating and responding to these increases in sodium concentration over time was explored by linking changes in ion distributions to those of enzyme abundance from the base to the tip of leaves under salt stress. We found that enzymes for methionine synthesis and lipid degradation pathways increase, concomitantly with proteins in jasmonate synthesis, which are key players in plant stress-induced responses. Combining the use of Differential Abundance of Protein analysis and Weighted Correlation Network Analysis we have focused on identifying key protein hubs associated with responses to salt stress or salt susceptibility, shedding light on potential sites of salt sensitivity as targets for enhancing salt tolerance in wheat. We found chloroplast protein synthesis machinery, including the 30S and 50S ribosomal proteins, and plastid localised protein synthesis elongation factors, were significantly reduced in abundance and correlated with the altered K+/Na+ ratio along salt-stressed wheat leaves. Additionally, the plastid protease system including ATP-dependent caseinolytic protease and filamentous temperature-sensitive H proteases involved in chloroplast protein homeostasis, show decreased abundance with salt. The complex interplay of these processes in and across the leaf affects overall plant viability under salt stress mainly affecting the energy homeostasis in wheat shoot.Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD059765.",

This study aimed to explore the molecular mechanisms of corneal damage in DED and evaluate QXRMY's therapeutic effects. A total of 120 C57BL/6 mice were divided into control, DED model, and QXRMY treatment groups. DIA sequencing of corneal tissue identified 2411 differentially expressed proteins. Enrichment analysis revealed these proteins were involved in RNA polymerase II regulation, apoptosis, and protein phosphorylation. KEGG pathway analysis highlighted key roles of the PI3K/AKT, HIF-1 signaling pathways, and cytoskeleton regulation in QXRMY's effects. FL, BUT, Schirmer I tests, HE, and PAS staining confirmed corneal damage in DED and the repair effects of QXRMY. ELISA showed QXRMY significantly reduced IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α levels, suggesting anti-inflammatory properties. PCR and Western blot further confirmed QXRMY repairs corneal damage via the PI3K/AKT/HIF1α pathway.

    "abstract": "Chromatin remodeling complexes, such as the Saccharomyces cerevisiae INO80 complex, exemplify how dynamic protein interaction networks govern cellular function through a balance of conserved structural modules and context-dependent functional partnerships, as revealed by integrative machine learning and structural mapping approaches. In this study, we explored the INO80 complex using machine learning to predict network changes caused by genetic deletions. Tree-based models outperformed linear approaches, highlighting non-linear relationships within the interaction network. Feature selection identified key INO80 components (e.g., Arp5, Arp8) and cross-compartment features from other remodeling complexes like SWR1 and NuA4, emphasizing shared functional pathways. Perturbation patterns aligned with biological modules, particularly those linked to telomere maintenance and aging, underscoring the functional coherence of these networks. Structural mapping revealed that not all interactions are predictable through proximity alone, particularly with Arp5 and Yta7. By combining structural insights with machine learning, we enhanced predictions of genetic perturbation effects, providing a template for analyzing cross-species homologs (e.g., human INO80) and their disease-associated variants. This integrative approach bridges the gap between static structural data and dynamic functional networks, offering a pathway to disentangle conserved mechanisms from context-dependent adaptations in chromatin biology.",

This study presents an analysis of the venom composition of Micrurus ephippifer, employing transcriptomic and proteomic methodologies. A total of 2885 venom gland transcripts were assembled, of which 42 were identified as toxins. Transcripts for three-finger toxins (3FTx) were the most abundant (80.7 %), followed by PLA2 transcripts (16.3 %). Tryptic peptide sequences obtained through bottom-up shotgun MS/MS venom analysis were assigned to 46 distinct proteins in the SwissProt/UniProt database, of which 23 belong to the 3FTx family. Peptide spectral matching against the venom gland transcriptome database identified 24 proteins, 12 of which correspond to 3FTx, and three belong to PLA2. Venom decomplexation by RP-HPLC followed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing of fractions allowed an estimation of the relative abundance of protein families, indicating that 3FTx comprise over 50 % of the venom. The identified toxic fractions displayed distinct lethality profiles in mice, with certain combinations exhibiting enhanced toxicity, very similar to what has been reported with Brownitoxin-I, with only the PLA2 sequence showing similarity. Our results emphasize the importance of integrating transcriptomic and proteomic approaches to understand venom diversity and its implications for antivenom development.",

To characterize its venom, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of the venom glands and the crude venom were performed. These two approaches utilized high-throughput sequencing to enhance the likelihood of detecting a wide range of venom proteins correlated with the venom proteome. After RNA venom gland extraction, a cDNA library was constructed and sequenced by RNA-seq. Also, the crude venom was digested using trypsin and chymotrypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed using a nano-LC-MS/MS. Notably, transcriptomic and proteomic venom approaches identified a hyaluronidase, alpha- and beta-neurotoxins that affect Na+ channels, CRISP proteins, metalloproteinases, transferrin, monooxygenase alpha-peptidyl-glycine, serine proteases, alpha pancreatic amylase, lysozyme, neurotoxins targeting K+ channels, neprilysin, scorpine, angiotensin-converting enzyme, insulin-like growth factor-binding domain proteins, nucleobindin-like proteins, and uncharacterized proteins. Interestingly, some of the venom proteins such as nucleobindin and angiotensin-converting enzymes have been not reported in the proteome, their predicted presence has only been previously derived from the genomic sequence of Centruroides sculpturatus and C. vittatus.

In this study, we performed quantitative proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses on S. pneumoniae as a function of competence induction. To calculate peptide abundance ratios between non-competent and competent samples we used dimethyl-tag labeling. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) beads were used for phosphopeptide enrichment and samples were analysed by LC-MS/MS. Our proteome analysis covers approximatively 63 % of the total bacterial protein content, identifying 82 proteins with significantly different abundance ratios, including some not previously linked to competence. 248 phosphopeptides were identified including 47 having different abundance ratios. Notably, the proteins with a change in phosphorylation in competent cells are different from the proteins with a change in expression, highlighting different pathways induced by competence and regulated by phosphorylation.

    "abstract": "COVID-19 is a human respiratory syndrome caused by the infection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that has a high rate of infection and mortality. Viruses modulate the host machinery by altering cellular mechanisms that favor their replication. One of the mechanisms that viruses exploit is the protein folding and processing of post-translational modifications that occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). When ER function is impaired, there is an accumulation of misfolded proteins leading to endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress). To maintain homeostasis, cells trigger an adaptive signaling mechanism called the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) which helps cells deal with stress, but under severe conditions, can activate the apoptotic cell death mechanism. This study elucidated an activation of a diversity of molecular mechanisms by Brazilian variants of SARS-CoV-2 by a time-resolved and large-scale characterization of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells proteomics and immunoblotting. Furthermore, it was shown that pharmacological UPR modulation could reduce viral release by counteracting the different viral activations of its cellular response. Analysis of human clinical specimens and disease outcomes focusing on ER stress reinforces the importance of UPR modulation as a host regulatory mechanism during viral infection and could point to novel therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Irradiation and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) are widely utilized tools in hematopoietic research to generate myeloablation and assess blood recovery dynamics. A comprehensive understanding of their effects on the hematopoietic system is essential for optimizing therapeutic strategies, refining experimental models to modulate hematotoxicity, and interpreting research outcomes. Despite their widespread application, the long-term hematopoietic impacts of irradiation and 5-FU, particularly on hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), remain incompletely characterized. In this study, we therefore examined the long-term effects of 2 Gy medium-dose ionizing radiation (MDIR) and 150 mg/kg 5-FU on HSCs and the hematopoietic system’s resilience to subsequent cytotoxic stress in mice. Our findings demonstrate that MDIR, but not 5-FU, induces sustained impairments in HSC function and results in the selective depletion of MHC class II- HSCs – a subset characterized by high self-renewal potential and hypersensitivity to irradiation-induced ROS production. Furthermore, MDIR significantly compromised hematopoietic recovery following a subsequent 5-FU challenge, as evidenced by substantially reduced platelet and red blood cell (RBC) counts during the critical recovery phase. These findings highlight the distinct and persistent impacts of MDIR and 5-FU on HSCs and hematopoietic function, revealing crucial differences in their mechanisms of action and long-term consequences on the hematopoietic system.",

    "abstract": "Despite the great advances in medicine, there is a compelling need to develop alternative strategies to effectively treat obesity with the use of plant-origin therapeutics. Cannabigerol (CBG) appears to be a novel promising compound for managing this increasingly prevalent disease requiring multifaceted pharmacotherapy. Therefore, the herein study aimed to evaluate the potential therapeutic properties of 2-week CBG administration on the muscular metabolism of sphingolipids as well as insulin signal transduction pathway in a rat model of obesity and insulin resistance (IR) induced by high-fat, high-sucrose (HFHS) diet. The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC/MS/MS) were used to determine the sphingolipids content, while the multiplex assay kit was applied to measure the level of the phosphorylated form of proteins from the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. The expression of various proteins engaged in the sphingolipid metabolism and insulin signaling was assessed using Western blotting. Our results showed that 2-week CBG treatment decreased the muscular content of most deleterious C16:0-Cer and C18:0-Cer ceramide species and reduced the intramuscular concentrations of sphinganine (SFA) and sphingosine (SFO), redirecting their metabolism toward phosphorylated derivatives, sphinganine-1-phosphate (SFA1P), and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), respectively. Simultaneously, CBG counteracted S1P efflux in skeletal muscle, inhibiting the tissue-specific S1P/S1PR3 signaling. CBG also activated the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, which increased the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) and its downstream targets in the myocytes of obese rats. These results suggest that CBG may play an essential homeostatic role in skeletal muscles and can protect from the development of obesity-associated metabolic derangements.",

Mitochondrial dysfunction, with its impaired energy production and increased oxidative stress, fuels the development of gastric tumours. Gastric cancer exhibits dysregulated mitochondrial functions, which contribute to metabolic reprogramming, decreased apoptosis sensitivity, therapeutic resistance, and enhanced tumour progression and metastasis. In addition, aberrations in mitochondrial DNA, respiratory chain complexes, and epigenetic alterations foster a pro-tumorigenic microenvironment. Although significant progress has been made in understanding the various molecular mechanisms involved in gastric carcinogenesis, further studies are needed to elucidate mitochondrial homeostasis in gastric cancer.

    "title": "Acalabrutinib alleviates metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease by regulating bile acid metabolism",
    "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a global epidemic of chronic liver disease currently lacking effective treatment. Evaluating the therapeutic effects of existing drugs on MASLD is a time and cost-effective strategy. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is an inflammatory signaling molecule playing an important role in the progression of MASLD. Aclabrutinib, a BTK inhibitor approved for treating mantle-cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, has not been investigated for its potential to treat MASLD. This study examined the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of aclabrutinib on MASLD using a high-fat diet-induced mouse model. Results demonstrated significant alleviation of pathological parameters associated with MASLD upon administration of aclabrutinib. TSE PhenoMaster results revealed that aclabrutinib increased energy expenditure in mice. Furthermore, aclabrutinib upregulated the expression of genes associated with thermogenesis and lipolysis in adipose tissues. Additionally, it inhibited the transcription of genes related to lipid absorption in the small intestine and liver, while increasing the expression of hormone-sensitive lipase, hepatic nuclear factor 4 alpha and fibroblast growth factor 21 in the liver. Further analysis indicated that aclabrutinib promoted the alternative pathway of bile acid synthesis while restoring gut microbiota homeostasis. The altered bile acid profiles upregulated G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 expression in adipose tissues as well as vitamin D receptor expression in liver and small intestine. Our findings suggest that by regulating bile acid metabolism and gut microbiota, aclabrutinib may promote thermogenesis and lipolysis, thereby alleviating MASLD. This study provides novel insights into clinical applications targeting BTK for treating MASLD.",

    "abstract": "It is unclear whether high mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) is associated with the malignant characterization of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), and whether it plays a key regulatory role in the process of enterovirus 71 (EV71)-induced brain damage. Firstly, we analyzed the correlation between clinical information and HMGB1 concentrations in patients with mild and severe HFMD. Immunofluorescence was used to determine the expression level of HMGB1 in astrocytes. The levels of cellular inflammatory factors (IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, TNF-α and TGF-β1), chemokines (CCL2, CXCL10 and CXCL12) and adhesion factors (integrin β, P-gp, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1) were detected by ELISA kits. Western blot was used to measure the levels of blood-brain barrier (BBB) stability related factors (retinoic acid (RA), ANG1, ApoE and IGF-1) in astrocytes and BBB structure related proteins (occluding, claudin, PTCH-1 and ZO-1) in endothelial cells. Clinical studies found that the expression of HMGB1 was closely related to the HFMD severity. Knockdown of HMGB1 alleviated EV71-induced neuron damage and inhibited cellular inflammation and apoptosis. Importantly, silencing HMGB1 depressed excessive proliferation and the inflammation response of astrocytes caused by EV71 infection. Furthermore, knockdown of HMGB1 enhanced BBB stability by improving astrocyte adhesion and endothelial tight junctions. Mechanistically, HMGB1 regulated the stability of BBB by regulating sHh signaling and secretion in astrocytes. In conclusion, the level of HMGB1 is closely related to the clinical symptoms of patients with HFMD, and inhibiting the expression of HMGB1 promotes BBB stability by promoting sHh signaling in astrocytes.",

    "abstract": "Chemotherapy is a primary therapeutic option in cancer treatment, but often associated with unwanted side effects and drug resistance. Claudin-3 (CLDN3) and claudin-4 (CLDN4) are essential components of tight junctions, frequently overexpressed in ovarian cancer, serve as potential therapeutic targets. In this study, we utilized flow cytometry, qPCR, Western blot, and animal experiments to investigate the regulation of CLDN3 and CLDN4 by chemotherapy drug, gemcitabine, in the ovarian cancer cell line A2780. We reported that gemcitabine can induce expression of CLDN3 and CLDN4 in ovarian cancer cells. Mechanistically, we showed that gemcitabine induces expression of CLDN3 and CLDN4 through p38 MAP kinase mediated transcriptional regulation. Overexpression of CLDN3 or CLDN4 functionally protected A2780 ovarian cancer from gemcitabine induced cell killing. It appears that gemcitabine induced expression of CLDN3/4 is a chemoresistance mechanism for cancer cells. Gemcitabine-induced upregulation of CLDN3/4 suggests that ovarian cancer cells may be more effectively targeted using claudin-3/4-specific antibodies or antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) in combination with chemotherapy, which could have clinical implications for ovarian cancer treatment in the future.",

    "title": "Serine phosphorylation of protein arginine methyltransferase Hmt1 is critical for controlling its protein levels",
    "abstract": "In eukaryotes, protein arginine methylation is a prevalent post-translational modification found in a multitude of proteins responsible for key biological processes, ranging from transcription to signaling. One model suggests that phosphorylation of serine 9 (S9) in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae major protein arginine methyltransferase Hmt1 is critical for its oligomerization and activity. In this study, we used classic biochemical approaches to demonstrate that neither the S9 phosphomimetic nor the non-phosphorylatable substitution mutants of Hmt1 affect its oligomerization. These mutants remain active in vivo, retaining their ability to methylate the SR-/hnRNP-like protein Npl3 and displaying a monomethylarginine and asymmetric dimethylarginine banding profile similar to that of the wild-type. In cells lacking Dbf2, the proposed kinase responsible for phosphorylating Hmt1 at S9, Npl3 remains methylated. Additionally, monomethylarginine and asymmetric dimethylarginine banding profiles in cells lacking Dbf2 mostly resemble those observed in the wild-type rather than in hmt1Δ cells. Synchronized yeast cells expressing either S9 substitution exhibit entry into the M phase of the cell cycle at a rate similar to that of both wild-type and hmt1Δ cells. Our results suggest that the C-terminal epitope tagging of Hmt1 is responsible for the previously observed loss of enzymatic activities, rather than the S9 phosphorylation status of Hmt1. Finally, we demonstrate that S9 phosphorylation plays a role in maintaining Hmt1 protein levels in vivo. Overall, our finding demonstrates a novel role for Hmt1 S9 phosphorylation in tuning its in vivo protein levels.",

    "abstract": "Cancer stem cells (CSCs) hold a significant role in cancer metastasis, high mortality and severity responsible for therapy resistance and tumour recurrence. The 26S proteasome system plays a major role in protein degradation in normal cells. As most cancers have upregulated 26S proteasome machinery, cancer cells use the 26S proteasome system in their favour for growth support by degrading unwanted proteins, but dysfunction of the 26S proteasome system induces apoptosis in cells. Here, we used hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and HSCs-derived conditioned media (CM) to target colorectal cancer stem cells (CRC-CSCs). HSCs are otherwise used extensively to save the lives of patients suffering from hematological malignancies and inherited blood disorders. HSCs-derived conditioned media contains various cytokines, chemokines, and secretory small molecules, which can also target the CRC-CSCs. Moreover, HSCs have exhibited CRC-CSC tropism in vitro in our pilot studies. As therapeutic uses of HSCs for targeting colorectal cancer (CRC) have never been reported, we hypothesized the CRC-CSC targeting properties of HSCs. Our results indicated altered protein function of CRC-CSCs upon co-culture with HSCs. Proteomics approaches showed that HSCs-CM disrupted 26S proteasomal complex and altered the mitochondrial bioenergetics, thereby activating apoptosis in CRC-CSCs. Furthermore, we observed that HSCs-CM significantly induced double-stranded DNA damage and proteasomal degradation, leading to apoptosis and upregulating the autophagy system. This study, hence, provides the prospective targeting of cancer stem cells using HSCs-CM, indicating a possible therapeutic approach.",

    "abstract": "Cancer has high mortality rate and occupies second position among major diseases. Despite extensive research and therapies, in every nook and corner of the world, death rate is increasing exponentially. Hallmarks of cancer are benchmarks of cancer cells describing the fundamental principle and capabilities of the cells transforming from normal to malignant tumour. One of the major ones among them is the deregulation of cellular metabolism or metabolic reprogramming, involving alterations in glucose and lipid metabolism. Progressive research in this area has visualized the vital role of lncRNAs in lipid metabolism with respect to AML. lncRNAs involve in various cellular processes and also contribute for significant functions of the cell like chromatin remodelling, transcriptional activation and repression, gene regulation, immune response, cell differentiation, and cell cycle regulation, in addition to oncogenic processes such as proliferation, angiogenesis, migration, and apoptosis. Structural similarities are observed among mRNAs and lncRNAs in terms of poly A-tail and 5’ cap however protein-coding regions are lacking. A large body of evidence has shown that lncRNAs directly or indirectly mediate lipid metabolism by activating downstream genes. Considering their potential involvement in leukemia, these lncRNAs can be explored and considered as biomarkers for therapeutics, prognosis, and diagnosis. The present review is planned to summarize the functional classification of lncRNAs, the role of lipid metabolism in cancer, different lncRNAs involved in leukemia, and different cancer types related to lipid metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Obesity significantly increases the risk of various diseases, particularly cancers, which present a serious threat to public health. Therefore, identifying cancers related to obesity and exploring their pathological pathways and key genes are highly significant for the prevention and treatment of these cancers. In this study, we propose the obesity and cancer edge connectivity based on expanded modular disease genes and expanded modular networks (OCEC_eDMN) algorithm, which based on the disease-related genes, Biological Process (BP) genes, and Protein-Potein Interaction (PPI) network. The algorithm utilizes Random Walk with Restart (RWR) to expand BP genes and disease genes to generate the expanded modular networks (eMNs) and disease genes (eMDs). Finally, this algorithm calculates the average interaction number between eMDs on eMNs. We utilize OCEC_eDMN to predict the ranking of 12 cancers related to obesity/morbid obesity and obtain an AUC of 0.93/0.84. Additionally, OCEC_eDMN reveals the significant BPs associated with obesity-cancer connections. For instance, \\\"gluconeogenesis\\\" plays a critical role in the connections between obesity and cancers. Through key driver analysis (KDA) on eMDs, we identify the key connectors in obesity-cancer connections. Genes such as GRB2 are instrumental in linking morbid obesity to colorectal cancer in the eMNs of “response to molecule of bacterial origin”. The significant eMNs and key genes provide valuable references for the prevention and treatment of obesity-related cancers and carry important theoretical implications.",

    "abstract": "Myofibroblast transition plays a crucial role in both fibrotic diseases and wound healing. Although SIRT2 regulates fibrosis, its mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the effects of SIRT2 inhibition on myofibroblast transition in human renal cells under quiescent conditions. HK-2 kidney proximal tubular epithelial cells were starved of serum, resulting in the formation of primary cilia. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) stimulation reduced both the number of ciliated cells and ciliary length. The ciliary defects resulted from a failure in autophagy termination, leading to the accumulation of OFD1, a negative regulator of ciliogenesis, at centriolar satellites. This phenomenon was correlated with the upregulation of fibrosis-related proteins. To elucidate the role of SIRT2 in the autophagy−ciliogenesis−fibrosis axis, cells were treated with AGK2, a specific inhibitor of SIRT2. AGK2 treatment promoted the formation of both autophagosomes and autolysosomes and facilitated OFD1 degradation at the centriolar satellites, resulting in the lengthening of primary cilia. Restoration of primary cilia by AGK2 was associated with the suppression of myofibroblast transition. In conclusion, SIRT2 inhibition attenuates TGF-β-induced fibrosis by promoting autophagy-mediated ciliogenesis. This study highlights SIRT2 as a potential therapeutic target for fibrotic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the aberrant aggregation and phosphorylation (ser129) of α-synuclein (α-syn, a presynaptic protein) which leads to the formation of pathogenic Lewy bodies. A critical factor in the pathogenesis of PD is the disruption of the cellular protein quality control system, where molecular chaperones and their co-chaperones are integral for mitigating proteotoxic stress. Although the role of molecular chaperones in PD and other protein aggregation diseases has been extensively investigated, the in vivo investigation of disaggregation chaperones, including HSP70, HSP105, and co-chaperone DNAJBs, remains relatively limited. The present study aims to elucidate the expression dynamics of the disaggregation molecular chaperones within the substantia nigra pars compacta of the rotenone-induced Parkinsonian rat model and its association with α-syn aggregation. The rotenone-treated rats exhibited significant behavioural symptoms, α-syn aggregation and degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, confirming the development of Parkinsonism. Significant upregulation of α-syn expression/phosphorylation and co-localization in TH+ve neurons in the SNpc of treated rats was observed. Further, the gene and protein analysis of HSP70, DNAJB6, and HSP105 were found to be upregulated and TH+ve neurons showed their co-localization with p-α-synser129 expression. The total proteomic analysis of SNpc correlated the altered cellular processes with cellular homeostasis imbalance. The observations of the present study provide an in vivo analysis of disaggregation-associated molecular chaperones in Parkinsonian or α-syn related conditions. The study can be helpful for further manipulation in the expression or activity of disaggregation-related chaperones for advanced therapeutic strategies and mechanistic studies in protein aggregation-associated diseases.",

    "title": "Protective effects of hydatid cyst fluid on inflammation and tissue damage in rat model of type 1 diabetes",
    "abstract": "Cystic echinococcosis, caused by Echinococcus granulosus, is a zoonotic disease with immunomodulatory properties attributed to hydatid cyst fluid (HCF). Given the immune-modulating and anti-inflammatory properties of HCF observed in other contexts, its potential therapeutic effects in diabetes remain unexplored. This study aimed to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of HCF on glycemic control, inflammatory cytokines, and tissue histopathology in a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced model of type 1 diabetes. Twenty male rats were randomly divided into four groups (n = 5): a healthy control group, a hydatid cyst group that received three intraperitoneal injections of HCF at two-week intervals, a diabetic group that received a single intraperitoneal dose of STZ to induce diabetes, and a hydatid cyst + diabetic group (HCF + STZ) that received both HCF treatment and STZ administration. Serum glucose levels, inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-10), and histopathological changes in pancreatic and renal tissues were analyzed. The HCF + STZ group demonstrated a significant reduction in serum glucose levels compared to the STZ-only group. Pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β were significantly decreased in HCF-treated diabetic rats, while the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was partially restored. Histopathological examination revealed severe pancreatic islet atrophy and renal degeneration in the diabetic group, which were markedly alleviated in the HCF + STZ group. These findings suggest that HCF’s immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties may mitigate hyperglycemia and inflammatory responses in type 1 diabetes, warranting further investigation into its mechanisms and clinical applications.",

    "title": "Enhancement of wound healing in diabetic mice by topical use of a peptide-ionic liquid conjugate",
    "abstract": "Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) are one of the most devastating complications of diabetes, with high impact on patient’s quality of life. In worst scenarios, DFU can lead to severe amputation or even death. DFUs are an easy target for microbial pathogens and their effective healing is hampered by the galloping increase of microbial resistance to antibiotics, including from the most prevalent pathogens in DFU, e.g. Staphylococcus aureus. As such, available antibiotics show poor efficacy in the treatment of DFU, leading to a chronic condition that is exacerbated by poor healing rates due to the persistent inflammation, poor oxygenation and low angiogenesis, leading to high risk of ischemia, among other conditions that typically affect patients with diabetes. Our group has recently designed new peptide-based strategies towards the topical treatment of DFU, whereby peptide-ionic liquid conjugates emerged as highly promising agents. One of the best such conjugates, C16-Im-PP4, results from coupling an imidazolium-based ionic liquid with intrinsic antimicrobial activity to the N-terminus of a collagen boosting peptide used in cosmetics, the pentapeptide-4. C16-Im-PP4 showed excellent in vitro properties, namely, wide-spectrum antimicrobial action and collagen-boosting effect on human dermal fibroblasts, prompting the in vivo study here reported. The peptide-ionic liquid conjugate was applied topically on wounds of mice with diabetes. The results show multitargeted actions, at a dose of 1 µg/wound including: i) anti-inflammatory; ii) antioxidant; iii) pro-collagenic; vi) pro-angiogenic; v) antimicrobial; and vi) improved wound maturation effects. Altogether, these results identify this technology as a novel topical treatment for DFU.",

    "title": "Unveiling a novel signalling pathway involving NRF2 and PGAM5 in regulating the mitochondrial unfolded protein response in stressed cardiomyocytes",
    "abstract": "The mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) is a conserved signalling pathway that initiates a specific transcriptional programme to maintain mitochondrial and cellular homeostasis under stress. Previous studies have demonstrated that UPRmt activation has protective effects in the pressure-overloaded human heart, suggesting that robust UPRmt stimulation could serve as an intervention strategy for cardiovascular diseases. However, the precise mechanisms of UPRmt regulation remain unclear. In this study, we present evidence that the NRF2 transcription factor is involved in UPRmt activation in cardiomyocytes during conditions of mitochondrial stress. Silencing NRF2 partially reduces UPRmt activation, highlighting its essential role in this pathway. However, constitutive activation of NRF2 via inhibition of its cytosolic regulator KEAP1 does not increase levels of UPRmt activation markers, suggesting an alternative regulatory mechanism independent of the canonical KEAP1-NRF2 axis. Further analysis revealed that NRF2 likely affects UPRmt activation through its interaction with PGAM5 at the mitochondrial membrane. Disruption of PGAM5 in cardiomyocytes subjected to mitochondrial stress reduces the interaction between PGAM5 and NRF2, enhancing nuclear translocation of NRF2 and significantly upregulating the UPRmt in an NRF2-dependent manner. This NRF2-regulated UPRmt amplification improves mitochondrial respiration, reflecting an enhanced capacity for cardiomyocytes to meet elevated energetic demands during mitochondrial stress. Our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting the NRF2-PGAM5-KEAP1 signalling complex to amplify the UPRmt in cardiomyocytes for cardiovascular and other diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Future studies should aim to elucidate the mechanisms via which NRF2 enhances the protective effects of UPRmt, thereby contributing to more targeted therapeutic approaches.",

There is now exciting data to suggest that these miRNAs can bind to other miRNAs, and this may have a broader impact on gene regulation in disease states. The oncomiR miR-21 is one of the highest-expressing miRNAs in cancer cells, and in this study, we characterise which miRNAs could be potential targets of miR-21. In cancer cells delivered with a miR-21 mimic, there was an observable shift of the miRNA milieu. We demonstrate that the miR-17–92a cluster, which harbours six miRNA members, may be a target for miR-21 regulation. Additionally, the primary transcript of miR-17–92a was reduced in the presence of miR-21. In the broader context of miR:miR regulation, overexpression of miR-21 shifted the expression of more than 150 miRNAs, including those known to regulate genes in cancer pathways such as the MAPK signalling and FoxO pathways. This study expands upon our limited understanding of miR:miR regulatory network and reinforces the concept that miRNAs can regulate each other, thereby influencing broader gene networks.",

    "title": "Integrated stress response-upregulated mitochondrial SLC1A5var enhances glucose dependency in human breast cancer cells in vitro",
    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women. The growth of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells is glucose-dependent. The integrated stress response (ISR) is a cellular stress response to glucose depletion. The ISR-solute carrier family 7 member 11 pathway is activated during glucose depletion and contributes to glucose dependence by decreasing intracellular glutamate levels. Solute carrier family 1 member 5 (SLC1A5) and the mitochondrial solute carrier family 1 member 5 variant (SLC1A5var) are glutamine transporters that play essential roles in the reprogramming of cancer metabolism. However, whether ISR can regulate mitochondrial SLC1A5var expression and further affect glucose dependence remains unclear. Glucose depletion-, oligomycin-, and salubrinal-activated activating transcription factor-4 (ATF4) induced SLC1A5var expression. ATF4 is critical for SLC1A5var regulation, as it binds to specific regulatory elements in its promoter. SLC1A5var knockdown decreases glucose depletion-induced cell death, whereas SLC1A5var overexpression increases glucose depletion-induced cell death in TNBC cells. SLC1A5var knockdown reduced cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration, whereas SLC1A5var overexpression increased cell proliferation and migration. Moreover, the knockdown of SLC1A5var reduces the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) while increasing the maximal OCR and ECAR under glucose depletion. These results suggest that activated ISR-induced increased expression of SLC1A5var may regulate mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and glycolytic metabolic characteristics to enhance glucose depletion-induced cell death. In conclusion, SLC1A5var plays a vital role in metabolic reprogramming and may be a potential target for breast cancer treatment.",

BLACE, a gene specifically expressed in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia shows little or no expression in mature B-lymphocytes. The current pilot study involves transcriptional analysis of BLACE in B-cell ALL patients. Expression of BLACE was high in both pediatric and adult ALL patients. Promoter analysis of the BLACE gene showed the presence of CAAT and TATA box promoters and G-rich sequences with a potential to form G-quadruplexes. Due to identification of TAL1 transcription factor binding sites within the BLACE promoter region, expression of TAL1 gene was measured and found to correlate with the BLACE expression. The presence of an overlapping G-rich sequence and TAL1 binding site at −1291 bps within BLACE promoter indicated a new target site for controlling BLACE expression. The docking studies performed between BLACE-TAL1 protein showed a binding score of −208.68 kcal/mol and identified 21 BLACE nucleotide - TAL1 residues interacting at the docking interface. Together, our findings suggested that BLACE gene specifically expressed in B-cell ALL could serve as a new therapeutic target.

    "abstract": "Autophagy, a cellular recycling mechanism, utilizes lysosomes for cellular degradation. Prolonged autophagy reduces the pool of functional lysosomes in the cell. However, lysosomal homeostasis is maintained through the regeneration of functional lysosomes during the terminal stage of autophagy, i.e. Autophagic lysosome reformation (ALR). Through confocal microscopy during glutamine starvation, we unravel the regeneration of tubules from autolysosomes by undertaking significant membrane remodeling, which majorly depends on mTOR reactivation, RAB7 dissociation, phosphatidyl inositol 3 phosphate (PI3P) dependent-dynamin 2 and clathrin recruitment. In glutamine-starved cells, we found mTOR is the central modulator in regulating ALR initiation, and its pharmacological inhibition with rapamycin leads to a decrease in lysosomal tubulation. Moreover, RAB7 and Clathrin are essential for tubule elongation and it showed that siRNA targeting RAB7 and Clathrin restricts tubule initiation under glutamine starvation. In this setting, we examined the physiological relevance of ALR during prolonged glutamine deprivation and found that genetic and pharmacological inhibition of critical proteins involved in ALR promotes cell death in oral cancer cells, establishing ALR is essential for maintaining cell survival during stress.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect and potential cytotoxicity of Myriocin, a natural sphingolipid synthesis inhibitor, on TGF-β1-induced myofibroblasts transformation of human dermal fibroblasts. We found that myriocin significantly attenuated the transcript levels of αSMA, CTGF, and MMP9 which are involved in the fibrosis process. Mitomycin C poorly affects the same pro-fibrotic markers while reducing fibroblasts motility as much as myriocin. At similar doses, five minutes of mitomycin C treatment consistently affects human dermal fibroblast viability and proliferation compared to prolonged myriocin application, strengthening already published data on the good tolerability of this natural compound.

    "title": "Regulatory role of AMPK/Nrf2 signaling pathway in sevoflurane-enhanced intestinal protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury",
    "abstract": "Intestinal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is common in clinical settings and is associated with high mortality. Sevoflurane, a widely used anesthetic, has long recognized for its protective effects against intestinal I/R injury, though the underlying mechanisms remain largely uncharacterized. In this study, using both in vivo and in vitro models, we uncovered a novel role of sevoflurane in preventing ferroptotic cell death during intestinal I/R injury. Sevoflurane treatment activated transcription factor Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) and upregulated its target genes involved in iron sequestration (FTL) and glutathione biosynthesis (SLC7A11 and GCLM). These changes reduced intracellular ferrous iron levels and alleviated iron-dependent oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, a hallmark of ferroptosis. Importantly, through large-scale kinome screening, we revealed that sevoflurane-induced Nrf2 activation was mediated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Sevoflurane treatment activated AMPK, which subsequently phosphorylated Nrf2 and prevented its degradation. Stabilized Nrf2 then entered nucleus, where it promoted the transcription of downstream targets. We concluded that sevoflurane exerts anti-ferroptoic function in intestinal I/R through the AMPK/Nrf2 signaling pathway. These results expand our knowledge about the pathogenesis of intestinal I/R injury, and provide novel insights for optimizing clinical treatments and developing novel therapeutic strategies.",

    "title": "Myc functions downstream of InR and their concurrent upregulation additively restricts pathogenesis of human poly(Q) disorders in Drosophila disease models",
    "abstract": "Human polyglutamine [poly(Q)] disorders are caused by abnormal expansion of CAG repeats in one gene (disease specific), yet a plethora of cellular pathways are found to be involved in their pathogenesis and progression. Despite the tremendous effort, all pursuits for the development of intervention therapy against these disorders seem futile. Recent reports suggest combination therapy as a potential strategy to combat the complex pathogenesis of such neurodegenerative disorders. The present study attempted to identify a combinatorial intervention strategy against human poly(Q) disorders in Drosophila disease models. Due to its immense potential to be stimulated by drugs, the evolutionarily conserved insulin signalling cascade which is well-established modifier of human poly(Q) pathogenesis was selected for the study. Genetic screening studies identified Drosophila Myc as a potential partner of insulin receptor (InR) that conferred additive rescue against poly(Q) induced neurodegeneration. Comprehensive analyses demonstrated InR and Myc to confer additive rescue against several events of pathogenesis, including aggregation of expanded poly(Q) containing proteins, transcriptional dysregulation, upsurge of cell death cascades, etc. Also, the synergistic rescue efficiency of InR and Myc was equally efficient in mitigating poly(Q) induced structural and functional deficits. The study also demonstrates that Myc functions downstream of InR signalling cascade to deliver rescue against human poly(Q) mediated toxicity in Drosophila disease models. In conclusion, the present study suggests that InR and Myc have the potential to be developed as a combinatorial therapeutic approach against human poly(Q) diseases.",

    "title": "QSOX1 exerts anti-inflammatory effects in sepsis-induced acute lung injury: Regulation involving EGFR phosphorylation mediated M1 polarization of macrophages",
    "abstract": "Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response caused by an infection, which can easily lead to acute lung injury. Quiescin Q6 sulfhydryl oxidase 1 (QSOX1) is a sulfhydryl oxidase involved in oxidative stress and the inflammatory response. However, there are few reports on the role of QSOX1 in sepsis-induced acute lung injury (SALI). In this study, mice model of SALI was constructed by intraperitoneal injection with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The increased inflammatory response and lactate dehydrogenase activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) indicated successful modeling. Increased QSOX1 expression was both observed in lung tissues and lung macrophages of sepsis mice accompanied by increased polarization of M1-type macrophages. To explore the role of QSOX1 in the SALI, lentivirus containing QSOX1-specific overexpression or knockdown vectors were used to change QSOX1 expression in LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells. QSOX1 suppressed LPS-induced M1 polarization and further inhibited inflammatory response in RAW264.7 cells. Interestingly, the phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), the promoter of M1 polarization in macrophages, was found to be downregulated upon QSOX1 overexpression in RAW264.7 cells. Mechanically, the binding of QSOX1 to EGFR protein promoted EGFR ubiquitination and degradation, thereby down-regulating EGFR phosphorylation. Moreover, inhibiting EGFR expression or its phosphorylation restored the impact of QSOX1 silencing on M1 polarization and inflammation in the LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells. In summary, QSOX1 may exert anti-inflammatory effects in SALI by inhibiting EGFR phosphorylation-mediated M1 macrophage polarization. This presented a potential target for the treatment and prevention of SALI.",

    "title": "MicroRNA-146b-5p/FDFT1 mediates cisplatin sensitivity in bladder cancer by redirecting cholesterol biosynthesis to the non-sterol branch",
    "abstract": "Chemotherapy against muscle-invasive bladder cancer is increasingly challenged by the prevalence of chemoresistance. The cholesterol biosynthesis pathway has garnered attention in studies of chemoresistance, but conflicting clinical and molecular findings necessitate a clearer understanding of its underlying mechanisms. Recently, we identified farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase 1 (FDFT1)—the first specific gene in this pathway—as a tumor suppressor and chemoresistance modulator. Raman spectroscopy revealed higher levels of FDFT1-related metabolites in chemotherapy-sensitive bladder cancer tissue compared to resistant tissue; however, this observation lacks mechanistic insight. FDFT1 expression was reduced in our cisplatin-resistant bladder cancer cells (T24R) compared to parental cisplatin-sensitive cells (T24). Using functional knockdown and ectopic overexpression in T24/T24R cells, we mechanistically demonstrate the pathway through which FDFT1 mediates cisplatin sensitivity in bladder cancer cells. Bioinformatics analysis and rescue experiments showed that microRNA-146b-5p directly targets and downregulates FDFT1, reducing the cisplatin sensitivity of T24 cells, which can be restored by forced FDFT1 expression. Further investigation into the downstream cholesterol pathway revealed that FDFT1 suppression redirects its substrate toward the non-sterol branch of the pathway, as evidenced by the upregulation of non-sterol branch-associated genes and a reduced total cholesterol level in the sterol branch. Since the non-sterol pathway leads to the prenylation of isoprenoids and activation of Ras and Rho family proteins involved in cancer progression and chemoresistance, our findings suggest that redirection of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway is a key mechanism underlying FDFT1-mediated cisplatin resistance in bladder cancer. The miR-146b-5p/FDFT1 axis represents a promising target for overcoming chemoresistance in bladder cancer.",

    "title": "High glucose induces DNA methyltransferase 1 dependent epigenetic reprogramming of the endothelial exosome proteome in type 2 diabetes",
    "abstract": "In response to hyperglycemia, endothelial cells (ECs) release exosomes with altered protein content and contribute to paracrine signalling, subsequently leading to vascular dysfunction in type 2 diabetes (T2D). High glucose reprograms DNA methylation patterns in various cell/tissue types, including ECs, resulting in pathologically relevant changes in cellular and extracellular proteome. However, DNA methylation-based proteome reprogramming in endothelial exosomes and associated pathological implications in T2D are not known. Hence, in the present study, we used Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), High Fat Diet (HFD) induced diabetic mice (C57BL/6) and clinical models to understand epigenetic basis of exosome proteome regulation in T2D pathogenesis . Exosomes were isolated by size exclusion chromatography and subjected to tandem mass tag (TMT) labelled quantitative proteomics and bioinformatics analysis. Immunoblotting was performed to validate exosome protein signature in clinically characterized individuals with T2D. We observed ECs cultured in high glucose and aortic ECs from HFD mouse expressed elevated DNA methyltransferase1 (DNMT1) levels. Quantitative proteomics of exosomes isolated from ECs treated with high glucose and overexpressing DNMT1 showed significant alterations in both protein levels and post translational modifications which were aligned to T2D associated vascular functions. Based on ontology and gene-function-disease interaction analysis, differentially expressed exosome proteins such as Thrombospondin1, Pentraxin3 and Cystatin C related to vascular complications were significantly increased in HUVECs treated with high glucose and HFD animals and T2D individuals with higher levels of glycated hemoglobin. These proteins were reduced upon treatment with 5-Aza-2’-deoxycytidine. Our study shows epigenetic regulation of exosome proteome in T2D associated vascular complications.",

    "abstract": "The human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) tends to misfold and self-assemble to form amyloid fibrils, which has been associated with the loss of function and viability of pancreatic β-cells in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The role of hIAPP in the development of insulin resistance (a hallmark of T2DM) in skeletal muscles – the major sites for glucose utilization – needs further investigation. Even though, insulin-resistant conditions have been known to stimulate hIAPP aggregation, the events that lead to the development of insulin resistance due to hIAPP aggregation in skeletal muscles remain unidentified. Here, we have attempted to identify metabolic perturbations in L6 myotubes that were exposed to increasing concentrations of recombinant hIAPP for different time durations. It was observed that hIAPP exposure was associated with increased mitochondrial and cellular ROS levels, loss in mitochondrial membrane potential and viability of the myotubes. Metabolomic investigations of hIAPP-treated myotubes revealed significant perturbations in o-phosphocholine, sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and dimethylamine levels (p < 0.05). Therefore, we anticipate that defects in glycerophospholipid metabolism and the associated oxidative stress and membrane damage may play key roles in the development of insulin resistance due to protein misfolding in skeletal muscles. In summary, the perturbed metabolites and their pathways have not only the potential to be used as early biomarkers to predict the onset of insulin resistance and T2DM but also as therapeutic targets for the effective management of the same.",

    "title": "ITCH inhibits alkaliptosis in human pancreatic cancer cells through YAP1-dependent SLC16A1 activation",
    "abstract": "Alkaliptosis is a type of pH-dependent cell death and plays an emerging role in tumor suppression. However, the key modulation mechanism of alkaliptosis remains largely unknown. In particular, the nucleus, as the centre of genetic and metabolic regulation, is crucial for the regulation of cellular life. It is not known whether nuclear proteins are involved in the regulation of alkaliptosis. Here, we isolated nuclear proteins to perform a proteomics that identified itchy E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (ITCH) as a natural inhibitor of alkaliptosis in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells. The downregulation of ITCH protein is associated with the induction of alkaliptosis in three human PDAC cell lines (SW1990, MiaPaCa2, and PANC1). Functionally, increasing ITCH expression reduces JTC801-induced growth inhibition and cell death. In contrast, knocking down ITCH using specific shRNA increases JTC801-induced cell growth inhibition in the short or long term, resulting in increased cell death. Mechanistically, JTC801-induced ITCH inhibition blocks large tumor suppressor kinase 1 (LATS1) ubiquitination, which in turn suppresses Yes1 associated transcriptional regulator (YAP1)-dependent the transcriptional activation of solute carrier family 16 member 1 (SLC16A1), a proton-linked monocarboxylate transporter that inhibits JTC801-induced alkaliptosis. Additionally, decreased expression of ITCH is associated with longer survival times in patients with PDAC. Collectively, our results establish an ITCH-dependent pathway that regulates alkaliptotic sensitivity in PDAC cells and deepen the understanding of alkaliptosis in targeted therapy.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is one of the threats to human health and survival. High fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity leads to adipose tissue fibrosis and a series of metabolic diseases. There are some people still thin under HFD, a phenomenon known as the \\\"obesity resistance (OR) phenotype\\\". It was found that Iroquois homeobox 3 (IRX3) is considered as a regulator in obesity, but the regulatory mechanism between OR and IRX3 is still unclear. In this study, we investigated OR on a HFD and the role of the IRX3 gene. Using mice, we observed that OR mice had lower body weights, reduced liver lipid synthesis, and increased white adipose tissue (WAT) lipolysis compared to obesity-prone (OP) mice. Additionally, OR mice exhibited spontaneous WAT browning and less fibrosis, correlating with higher Irx3 expression. Utilizing 3T3-L1 differentiated adipocytes, our study demonstrated that overexpression of Irx3 promoted thermogenesis-related gene expression and reduced adipocyte fibrosis. Therefore, Irx3 promotes WAT browning and inhibits fibrosis in OR mice. These results provide insight into the differences between obesity and OR, new perspectives on obesity treatment, and guidance for lessening adipose tissue fibrosis.",

    "title": "Upregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ with resorcinol alleviates reactive oxygen species generation and lipid accumulation in neuropathic lysosomal storage diseases",
    "abstract": "Neuropathic lysosomal storage diseases (NLSDs), including ceroid lipofuscinosis neuronal 3 (CLN3) disease and Gaucher disease type 2 (GD2), are typically present in adolescents; however, there are no approved therapies. CLN3 disease is the most common of the 13 types of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, and Gaucher disease is the most common type of lysosomal storage disease. These NLSDs share oxidative stress and lysosomal dysfunction with Parkinson’s disease. In this study, we used patient-derived cells (PDCs) and resorcinol to develop a therapeutic agent based on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) activation. PPARγ is a major regulator of autophagy and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Resorcinol, a polyphenolic compound, has been reported to exhibit PPARγ agonistic potential. Protein levels were analyzed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. Changes in cellular metabolism, including ROS levels, lipid droplet content, and lysosomal activity, were measured by flow cytometry. Resorcinol reduced ROS levels by suppressing hypoxia-inducible factor 1α levels in CLN3-PDCs. Resorcinol upregulated autophagy and reduced lipid accumulation in CLN3-PDCs; however, these effects were abolished by autophagy inhibitors. Resorcinol increased nuclear PPARγ levels in CLN3-PDCs, and PPARγ antagonists abolished the therapeutic effects of resorcinol. Moreover, Resorcinol upregulated nuclear PPARγ levels and lysosomal activity in GD2-PDCs, and reduced lipid accumulation and ROS levels. In summary, resorcinol alleviated the shared pathogenesis of CLN3 disease and GD2 through PPARγ upregulation. These findings suggest that resorcinol is a potential therapeutic candidate for alleviating NLSD progression.",

Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) have therapeutic effects on PTC. Accordingly, this study probed into the potential relation of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and ACAP3 in PTC. Expressions of ACAP3 and HDAC2 in PTC were investigated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The relationship between HDAC2 and ACAP3 was predicted by Pearson analysis. Cell functional assays (cell counting kit-8, transwell, wound healing and flow cytometry assays) and rescue assay were carried out to determine the effects of HDAC2/ACAP3 axis on biological behaviors of PTC cells. Expressions of apoptosis-, epithelial-mesenchymal transition-, Protein Kinase B (AKT)-, and P53-related proteins were measured by Western blot. ACAP3 level was downregulated in PTC tissues and cells. ACAP3 overexpression (oe-ACAP3) suppressed viability, proliferation, migration and invasion of PTC cells, facilitated apoptosis, downregulated the expressions of Protein Kinase B (Bcl-2) and N-cadherin, upregulated the expressions of Bcl-2 associated protein X (Bax) and E-cadherin, diminished the p-AKT/AKT ratio and elevated the p-p53/p53 ratio; however, ACAP3 silencing or HDAC2 overexpression (oe-HDAC2) did the opposite. HDAC2 negatively correlated with ACAP3. The tumor-suppressing effect of oe-ACAP3 in PTC was reversed by oe-HDAC2.

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common type of cancer in the world. It is characterized by complex crosstalk between various signaling pathways, as a result of which it is highly challenging to identify optimal therapeutic targets and design treatment strategies. In this study, we tested the effect of 700 compounds on the CRC cell line HT-29 by using the sulforhodamine B assay and screened out 17 compounds that exhibited high toxicity (indicated by an inhibition rate of ≥75 % when applied at a concentration of 10 µM) against the HT-29 cell line. Next, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the effects of these 17 highly toxic compounds. The results of ferroptosis analysis and electron microscopy showed that compounds 575 and 578 were able to significantly reverse RSL3-induced increase in ferroptosis, while compound 580 had a less pronounced ferroptosis-regulating effect. In subsequent experiments, western blotting showed that compounds 575, 578, and 580, which belong to a class of meroterpene-like compounds that affect ferroptosis, do not induce autophagy or apoptosis in the CRC cell line. Instead, Fe2+ chelation experiments showed that these three compounds can serve as iron chelators by chelating Fe2+ at a 1:1 (chelator: Fe2+) ratio. Specifically, the aldehyde and hydroxyl groups of the benzene ring in these compounds may chelate Fe2+, thus reducing Fe2+ levels in cells and inhibiting ferroptosis. These results indicate that these novel meroterpene-like compounds are potential therapeutic small-molecule candidates for targeting ferroptosis in tumors.",

Teprenone has been reported to have a significant positive effect on intestinal mucosal lesions, but long-term use of teprenone can elicit adverse reactions. WeiNaiAn capsule is a traditional Chinese medicine formulation used widely in the treatment of gastric and duodenal mucosal injury. However, how WeiNaiAn protects against intestinal mucosal injury and its mechanism of action are not known. In this study, WeiNaiAn capsule or Teprenone treatment improved the intestinal mucosal pathological score and antioxidant level in indomethacin-induced rats. 16 S rRNA sequence data showed WeiNaiAn capsule reverted the structure community and replenished the beneficial bacteria. Furthermore, fingerprint analysis revealed multiple components of WeiNaiAn capsule, including calycosin glucoside, ginsenoside Rg1, ginsenoside Rb1, taurocholic acid sodium, formonetin, and calycosin glucoside. The components of WeiNaiAn capsule promoted the wound healing of the epithelial cell in vitro. Moreover, the components of WeiNaiAn capsule inhibited the protein expressions of phosphoinositide 3-kinase /protein kinase B /mammalian target of rapamycin in hydrogen peroxide or lipopolysaccharides-induced cell model. In conclusion, WeiNaiAn capsule improves intestinal mucosal injury by regulating cell migration, enhancing antioxidant activity, and promoting the structure of the bacterial community homeostasis, the multiple targets provide the parameters for the treatment in the clinic.",

    "abstract": "Thermoregulation and thermal homeostasis at the cellular and subcellular organelle level are poorly understood events. In this work, we used BV2, a microglial cell line, and a series of thermo-sensitive subcellular organelle-specific probes to analyze the relative changes in the spatio-temporal temperatures of different subcellular organelles, both qualitatively and quantitatively. These methodologies allowed us to understand the thermal relationship of different subcellular organelles also. We modulated BV2 cells by pharmacological application of activator or inhibitor of TRPM8 ion channel (a cold-sensitive ion channel) and/or by treating the cells with LPS, a molecule that induces pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) signaling. We demonstrate that the temperatures of individual organelles remain variable within a physiological range, yet vary in different conditions. We also demonstrate that treating BV2 cells by TRPM8 modulators and/or LPS alters the organelle temperatures in a specific and context-dependent manner. We show that TRPM8 modulation and/or LPS can alter the relationship of mitochondrial membrane potential to mitochondrial temperature. Our work suggests that mitochondrial temperature positively influences ER temperature and negatively influences Golgi temperature. Golgi temperature positively influences membrane temperature. This understanding of thermal relationships may be crucial for dissecting cellular structures, function, and stress signaling and may be relevant for different diseases.",

    "title": "Pyrazoles have a multifaceted anti-inflammatory effect targeting prostaglandin E2, cyclooxygenases and leukocytes’ oxidative burst",
    "abstract": "Elevated levels of prostaglandin E2 have been implicated in the pathophysiology of various diseases. Anti-inflammatory drugs that act through the inhibition of cyclooxygenase enzymatic activity, thereby leading to the suppression of prostaglandin E2, are often associated with several side effects due to their non-specific inhibition of cyclooxygenase enzymes. Consequently, the targeted suppression of prostaglandin E2 production with innovative molecules and/or mechanisms emerges as a compelling therapeutic strategy for the treatment of inflammatory-related diseases. Therefore, in this study, a systematic analysis of 28 pyrazole derivatives was conducted to explore their potential mechanisms for reducing prostaglandin E2 levels. In this context, the evaluation of these derivatives extended to examining their capacity to reduce prostaglandin E2 in vitro in human whole blood, inhibit cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 enzymes, modulate cyclooxygenase-2 expression, and suppress oxidative burst in human leukocytes. The results enabled the establishment of significant structure-activity relationships, elucidating key determinants for their activities. In particular, the 4-styryl group on the pyrazole moiety and the presence of chloro substitutions were identified as key determinants. Pyrazole 8 demonstrated the capacity to reduce prostaglandin E2 levels by downregulating cyclooxygenase-2 expression, and pyrazole-1,2,3-triazole 18 emerged as a dual-acting agent, inhibiting human leukocytes' oxidative burst and cyclooxygenase-2 activity. Furthermore, pyrazole 26 demonstrated effective reduction of prostaglandin E2 levels through selective cyclooxygenase-1 inhibition. These results underscore the multifaceted anti-inflammatory potential of pyrazoles, providing new insights into the substitutions and structural frameworks that are beneficial for the studied activity.",

    "abstract": "Abemaciclib (ABM), a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor, shows pharmacological effects in cell cycle arrest. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition is an important cellular event associated with pathophysiological states such as organ fibrosis and cancer progression. In the present study, we evaluated the contribution of factors associated with cell cycle arrest to ABM-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Treatment with 0.6 µM ABM induced both cell cycle arrest and epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related phenotypic changes. Interestingly, the knockdown of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6, pharmacological targets of ABM or cyclin D1, which forms complexes with cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6, resulted in cell cycle arrest at the G1-phase and induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, indicating that downregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6-cyclin D1 complexes would mimic ABM. In contrast, knockdown of the Rb protein, which is phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6, had no effect on the expression level of α-smooth muscle actin, an epithelial-mesenchymal transition marker. Furthermore, ABM-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition was not affected by Rb knockdown, suggesting that Rb is not involved in the transition process. Our study is the first to suggest that cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6-cyclin D1 complexes, as pharmacological targets of ABM, may contribute to ABM-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition, followed by clinical disorders such as organ fibrosis and cancer progression. This study suggests that blocking epithelial-mesenchymal transition might be a promising way to prevent negative side effects caused by a medication (ABM) without affecting its ability to treat the disease.",

    "abstract": "Colon cancer has become a global public health challenge, and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) chemoresistance is a major obstacle in its treatment. Chemoresistance can be mediated by therapy-induced cellular senescence. This study intended to investigate mechanisms of INHBA (inhibin A) in 5-FU resistance mediated by cellular senescence in colon cancer. Bioinformatics analysis of INHBA expression in colon cancer tissues, survival analysis, and correlation analysis of cellular senescence markers were performed. The effects of INHBA on the biological characteristics and 5-FU resistance of colon cancer cells were examined through loss/gain-of-function and molecular assays. Finally, a xenograft mouse model was built to validate the mechanism of INHBA in vivo. INHBA was upregulated in colon cancer and was significantly positively correlated with cellular senescence markers uncoupling protein 2 (UCP-2), matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), dense and erect panicle 1 (DEP1), and p21. Cellular senescence in colon cancer mediated 5-FU resistance. Downregulation of INHBA expression enhanced 5-FU sensitivity in colon cancer cells, inhibited cell proliferation, promoted apoptosis, increased the proportion of cells in G0/G1 phase, and it resulted in a lower proportion of senescent cells and lower levels of the cellular senescence markers interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin 8 (IL-8). Analysis of whether to use the pathway inhibitor Verteporfin proved that INHBA facilitated colon cancer cell senescence and enhanced 5-FU chemoresistance via inactivation of Hippo signaling pathway, and consistent results were obtained in vivo. Collectively, INHBA conferred 5-FU chemoresistance mediated by cellular senescence in colon cancer cells through negative regulation of Hippo signaling.",

    "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) poses significant challenges in treatment due to its aggressive nature and limited therapeutic targets. Understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms driving TNBC progression and chemotherapy resistance is imperative for developing effective therapeutic strategies. Thus, in this study, we aimed to elucidate the role of pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 3 (PYCR3) in TNBC pathogenesis and therapeutic response. We observed that PYCR3 is significantly upregulated in TNBC specimens compared to normal breast tissues, correlating with a poorer prognosis in TNBC patients. Knockdown of PYCR3 not only suppresses TNBC cell proliferation but also reverses acquired resistance of TNBC cells to doxorubicin, a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent. Mechanistically, we identified the mitochondrial localization of PYCR3 in TNBC cells and demonstrated its impact on TNBC cell proliferation and sensitivity to doxorubicin through the regulation of mtDNA copy number and mitochondrial respiration. Importantly, Selective reduction of mtDNA copy number using the mtDNA replication inhibitor 2′, 3′-dideoxycytidine effectively recapitulates the phenotypic effects observed in PYCR3 knockout, resulting in decreased TNBC cell proliferation and the reversal of doxorubicin resistance through apoptosis induction. Thus, our study underscores the clinical relevance of PYCR3 and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target in TNBC management. By elucidating the functional significance of PYCR3 in TNBC, our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of TNBC biology and provide a foundation for developing novel therapeutic strategies aimed at improving patient outcomes.",

This study aims to explore the role of AKT serine/threonine kinase 2 (AKT2) in mitigating DOX-induced oxidative stress within the heart through both intracellular and extracellular signaling pathways. Utilizing Akt2 knockout (KO) and Nrf2 KO murine models, alongside neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs), we systematically investigate the impact of AKT2 deficiency on DOX-induced cardiac injury. Our findings reveal that DOX administration induces significant oxidative stress, a primary contributor to cardiac injury. Importantly, Akt2 deficiency exhibits a protective effect by alleviating DOX-induced oxidative stress. Mechanistically, Akt2 deficiency facilitates nuclear translocation of NRF2, thereby suppressing intracellular oxidative stress by promoting the expression of antioxidant genes. Furthermore, We also observed that AKT2 inhibition facilitates superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) expression both inside macrophages and SOD2 secretion to the extracellular matrix, which is involved in lowering oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes upon DOX stimulation. The present study underscores the important role of AKT2 in mitigating DOX-induced oxidative stress through both intracellular and extracellular signaling pathways.

    "abstract": "Circadian genes play an important role in the field of drug metabolism. Flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 is a well-known phase I enzyme which participates in metabolism of many exogenous and endogenous substances, especially production of trimethylamine N-oxide. Here, we aimed to decipher diurnal rhythms of flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 expression and activity, and explore the regulation mechanism by clock genes. Our results showed that its mRNA and protein exhibited robust diurnal rhythms in mouse liver and cell lines. Consistently, significant alterations were observed for in vitro microsomal N-oxidation rates of procainamide, which kept in line with its protein expression at different time in wild-type and reverse erythroblastosis virus α knockout mice. Further, flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 was negatively regulated by E4 promoter-binding protein 4 in AML12 and Hepa1–6 cells, while it was positively influenced by reverse erythroblastosis virus α and brain and muscle ARNT-like protein-1. Moreover, luciferase reporter assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed E4 promoter-binding protein 4 inhibited the transcription of flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 by binding to a D-box1 element (−1606/−1594 bp), while brain and muscle ARNT-like protein-1 positively activated the transcription via direct binding to three E-boxes (−863/−858 bp, −507/−498 bp, and −115/−104 bp) in this enzyme promoter.

    "abstract": "Tujia ethnomedicine Xuetong (the stems of Kadsura heteroclita) have been widely used in folk for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which can alleviate rheumatic pain through liquor soaking in folk. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the pharmacological effects and underlying mechanism of Xuetongsu (a key chemical component of Xuetong) on bone destruction. In our previous study, it was found that Xuetong extract can reduce adjuvant arthritic rats paw swelling and inhibit inflammatory factors in serum. Furthermore, Xuetongsu has been demonstrated to inhibit the proliferation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes, but its potential to inhibit bone destruction has not been explored. To address this, we employed the STRING database to predict protein interactions and utilized Autodock software to simulate the binding of Xuetongsu to target proteins. In this study, administration of Xuetongsu significantly alleviated paw swelling and bone destruction in C57BL/6 mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Mechanistic studies have indicated that Xuetongsu promotes apoptosis of mature osteoclasts in joint tissues by activating Caspase-3 and Bax, while inhibiting Bcl-2. Additionally, Xuetongsu inhibits osteoclast differentiation by suppressing RANKL, RANK, P-NF-κB, and NFATc1, and reduces bone resorption activity by inhibiting MMP-9, CTSK, and TRAP. Importantly, Xuetongsu exhibits good biocompatibility in major organs of mice. In summary, Xuetongsu has the potential to treat bone destruction by promoting apoptosis of mature osteoclasts, inhibiting osteoclast differentiation, and reducing bone resorption. This study reveals the pharmacological effects of Xuetongsu and its mechanism of action, which may contribute to the development of novel approaches for treating RA.",

    "abstract": "Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is one of the most common diseases in elderly men worldwide that may result in lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). At present, the specific pathophysiological mechanism for BPH/LUTS LUTS remains unclear. S100 calcium binding protein A4 (S100A4), a member of the calcium binding protein family, regulates a variety of biological processes including cell proliferation, apoptosis and fibrosis. The aim of the current study was to explore and clarify the possible role of S100A4 in BPH/LUTS. The human prostate stromal cell line (WPMY-1), rat prostate epithelial cells, human prostate tissues and two BPH rat models were employed in this study. The expression and localization of S100A4 were detected by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR), immunofluorescence microscopy, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry analysis. Also, S100A4 knockdown or overexpression cell models were constructed and a BPH rat model was induced with testosterone propionate (T) or phenylephrine (PE). The BPH animals were treated with Niclosamide, a S100A4 transcription inhibitor. Results demonstrated that S100A4 was mainly localized in human prostatic stroma and rat prostatic epithelium, and showed a higher expression in BPH. Knockdown of S100A4 induced cell apoptosis, cell proliferation arrest and a reduction of tissue fibrosis markers. Overexpression of S100A4 reversed the aforementioned changes. We also demonstrated that S100A4 regulated proliferation and apoptosis mainly through the ERK pathway and modulated fibrosis via Wnt/β-catenin signaling. In conclusion, our novel data demonstrate that S100A4 could play a crucial role in BPH development and may be explored as a new therapeutic target of BPH.",

    "abstract": "Given the high concentration of iron in the micro-environment of ovarian endometriosis, it is plausible to hypothesize that ectopic endometrial cells may be more susceptible to undergoing ferroptosis. Manipulation of ferroptosis has been explored as a potential therapeutic strategy to treat related diseases. In this study, we examined the impact on ectopic endometrial stromal cells (EESCs) of iron overload and an inducer of ferroptosis. We found that the iron concentration in the ovarian endometriosis was much higher than control samples. Treatment of cultured EESCs with ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) increase the sensitivity to undergo ferroptosis. By analyzing the RNA-seq results, it was discovered that zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit (EZH2) was significantly downregulated in ferroptosis induced EESCs. Moreover, overexpression of EZH2 effectively prevented the induction of ferroptosis. In addition, the activity or expression of EZH2 is directly and specifically inhibited by the methyltransferase inhibitor GSK343, which raises the sensitivity of stromal cells to ferroptosis. Taken together, our findings revealed that EZH2 act as a suppressor in the induced cell ferroptosis through a PRC2-independent methyltransferase mechanism. Therefore, blocking EZH2 expression and inducing ferroptosis may be effective treatment approaches for ovarian endometriosis.",

    "title": "An update on the cell-free DNA-derived methylome as a non-invasive biomarker for coronary artery disease",
    "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases are the foremost contributor to global mortality, presenting a complex etiology and an expanding array of risk factors. Coronary artery disease characterized by atherosclerotic plaque build-up in the coronary arteries, imposes significant mortality and financial burdens, especially in low- and middle-income nations. The pathogenesis of coronary artery disease involves a multifaceted interplay of genetic, environmental, and epigenetic factors. Epigenetic regulation contributes to the dynamic control of gene expression without altering the underlying DNA sequence. The mounting evidence that highlights the pivotal role of epigenetic regulation in coronary artery disease development and progression, offering potential avenues for the development of novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Abnormal DNA methylation patterns are linked to the modulation of gene expression involved in crucial processes like lipid metabolism, inflammation, and vascular function in the context of coronary artery disease. Cell-free DNA has become invaluable in tumor biology as a liquid biopsy, while its applications in coronary artery disease are limited, but intriguing. Atherosclerotic plaque rupture causes myocardial infarction, by depriving heart muscles of oxygen, releasing cell-free DNA from dead cardiac cells, and providing a minimally invasive source to explore tissue-specific epigenetic alterations. We discussed the methodologies for studying the global methylome and hydroxy-methylome landscape, their advantages, and limitations. It explores methylome alterations in coronary artery disease, considering risk factors and their relevance in coronary artery disease genesis. The review also details the implications of MI-derived cell-free DNA for developing minimally invasive biomarkers and associated challenges.",

    "abstract": "TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) is involved in different cellular processes including signal transduction and transcription regulation. We here provide evidence of a direct interaction between the TRAF domain of TRAF2 and the monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM1). Previously, we showed that the TRAF domain occurs mainly in a trimeric form in solution, but it can also exist as a stable monomer when in the nanomolar concentration range. Here, we report that the quaternary structure of the TRAF domain is also affected by pH changes, since a weakly acidic pH (5.5) favors the dissociation of the trimeric TRAF domain into stable monomers, as previously observed at neutral pH (7.6) with the diluted protein. The TRAF domain-GM1 binding was similar at pH 5.5 and 7.6, suggesting that GM1 interacts with both the trimeric and monomeric forms of the protein. However, only the monomeric protein appeared to cause membrane deformation and inward vesiculation in GM1-containing giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). The formation of complexes between GM1 and TRAF2, or its TRAF domain, was also observed in cultured human leukemic HAP1 cells expressing either the truncated TRAF domain or the endogenous full length TRAF2. The GM1-protein complexes were observed after treatment with tunicamycin and were more concentrated in cells undergoing apoptosis, a condition which is known to cause cytoplasm acidification. These findings open the avenue for future studies aimed at deciphering the physiopathological relevance of the TRAF domain-GM1 interaction.",

    "abstract": "Cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 (CLCF1) is a cytokine of the IL6/IL12 family with immune-modulating functions, mainly on B cells and myeloid cells. CLCF1 also plays a crucial role in the embryonic development of motor neurons, such that Clcf1-knock out mice are not viable. In order to further study the immune activities of CLCF1, we used a mouse model with a knock-out of Clcf1 in hematopoietic cells under the Vav promoter. While characterizing this model, we observed that CD4+ T cells from Clcf1−/− mice produced more IFNγ than those from Clcf1+/+ mice when activated in the presence of IL12. We also observed that CLCF1 induces a downregulation of IL12Rβ2 expression levels. We further demonstrated that CLCF1 interacts with IL12Rβ2 and promotes its degradation through the proteasome in a manner independent of ubiquitination. Altogether, these results suggest that CLCF1 can act as a negative regulator of IL12 activity, a role which could be exploited therapeutically to dampen the inflammatory response driven by Th1 cells. Our observations may also hint at a new role for CLCF1 as a mediator of protein degradation.",

    "abstract": "Psoriasis is an incurable, immune-mediated inflammatory disease characterized by the hyperproliferation, abnormal differentiation of keratinocytes and a strong interferon gamma inflammatory signature. Interferon gamma plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including activation of dendritic cells, antigen processing and presentation, cell adhesion and trafficking, and cytokine and chemokine production. These cellular processes are also integral components in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. To gain a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of interferon gamma -induced psoriasis, psoriatic human epidermis equivalents were developed by stimulating healthy human epidermis equivalents with interferon gamma. Subsequently, the psoriatic human epidermis equivalents were treated with a novel enzyme, Streptococcal C5a peptidase, and compared to treatment using an established psoriasis drug, retinoic acid. Histological evaluation and barrier function assays, including lucifer yellow and biotin penetration assays, revealed that the integrity of the cellular barrier was compromised in samples treated with Interferon gamma alone, whereas treatment with Streptococcal C5a peptidase and retinoic acid successfully restored barrier function. Consistently, immunofluorescence and gene expression analysis of accepted biomarkers of psoriatic pathogenesis indicated that treatment with both drugs markedly reduced the psoriatic human epidermis equivalents phenotype, with greater efficacy observed for Streptococcal C5a peptidase. Thus, Streptococcal C5a peptidase demonstrated a robust modulating ability in restoring skin health in interferon gamma -induced skin psoriasis.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes, via chronic metabolic and inflammatory dysregulation, may impair immune function and contribute to cognitive decline, particularly in executive functions. In this study, we examined changes in the cytokines IL-10 and TNF, as well as their balance, alongside executive function, physical performance, and diabetes-related indices following a combined, dual-task, home-based exercise training program. A total of 85 inactive women aged 50–75 years with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to either an exercise training group or a control group. During the pre- and post-test phases, assessments were conducted in both groups to measure executive function, physical performance, levels of IL-10 and TNF, their ratio, and diabetes-related indices. The dual-tasked home-based exercise program improved physical performance and body composition (P < 0.05). Executive function significantly improved in the exercise group (Effect size (ES) = 0.44, P < 0.05), accompanied by reductions in IL-10 (ES = 1.11, P < 0.05) and TNF levels (ES = 0.76, P < 0.05). However, no significant changes were observed in the balance of these two cytokines or diabetes-related indices (P > 0.05), except for HDL levels (ES = 0.87, P < 0.05). Based on the results of the present study, engaging in multi-task home-based exercise training can enhance executive function and reduce inflammatory cytokines in women with type 2 diabetes. However, this training did not significantly affect the balance between IL-10 and TNF, which may be due to the moderate intensity of the exercises. Further long-term studies that take into account additional factors—such as nutrition, medication use, and cognitive status—are warranted to gain a clearer understanding of the cytokine-modulating effects of dual-task exercise training in individuals with type 2 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is generally recognized as a rapidly progressive syndrome of excessive immune activation and a cytokine storm. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), a prevalent subgroup of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, represents a common trigger of HLH. Due to the overlap in clinical manifestations between HLH and the underlying lymphoma, it is challenging to identify secondary HLH (sHLH) in DLBCL patients early. To elucidate the differences between DLBCL with HLH (DLBCL-HLH) and DLBCL without HLH (DLBCL-non-HLH), we comparatively analyzed the clinical parameters and serum cytokines in patients with DLBCL-HLH or DLBCL-non-HLH. Serum levels of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β, IL-17 A, IL-10, IL-12P70, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interferon (IFN)-γ, and IFN-α in 8 patients with DLBCL-HLH and 51 patients with DLBCL-non-HLH were measured by cytometric bead array. Compared to patients with DLBCL-non-HLH, those with DLBCL-HLH had significantly elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, increased serum ferritin levels, raised liver transaminases, a higher proportion of lymphoma bone marrow involvement, significantly decreased albumin levels, and reduced peripheral blood cell counts. Both in patients with DLBCL-HLH and those with DLBCL-non-HLH, serum levels of IL-6 and IL-10 were elevated. However, these cytokine levels were significantly higher among patients with DLBCL-HLH. In particular, when the level of IL-10 > 180.70 pg/ml, the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnosis of DLBCL-HLH were 87.50 % and 96.08 %, respectively. Interestingly, in patients with DLBCL-non-HLH, we observed that IL-10 positively correlated with serum ferritin levels (r = 0.768, P < 0.001), and negatively correlated with hemoglobin concentrations and platelet counts (r = −0.388, P = 0.005; r = −0.412, P = 0.003). Taken together, our results revealed that elevated serum IL-10 levels are significantly associated with sHLH in DLBCL patients, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic biomarker. High serum IL-10 levels, combined with bone marrow involvement by lymphoma, high lactate dehydrogenase, decreased albumin levels, and HLH diagnostic criteria such as increased ferritin levels and cytopenia, might boost the early identification of DLBCL-HLH.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOsteoarthritis (OA) is among the common chronic health conditions which impacts many aspects of an individual’s life from physical function to mental health. Inflammation, in the joint as well as system inflammation is among the many mechanisms hypothesized to be involved in OA. IL-33 which belongs to the IL-1 family, is considered as an alarmin in OA. IL-33 binds to a group of receptors to stimulate signaling among which is the ST2L receptor that induced the activation of NFƙb, thus, working as a booster of the inflammatory cascade. Many polymorphisms have been identified on the IL-33 gene which are assumed to be associated with inflammatory diseases.",

    "abstract": "Background: The expression of serum progranulin (PGRN) and the related immunological mechanisms of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) CD4 + T cells exosomes in thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) are currently hot topics of research. Material and Method: A total of 27 patients with active TAO and 59 healthy individuals were included in the study for comparison. PBMCs were isolated from the patients' blood, and naïve CD4+ T cells were purified using human naïve CD4 microbeads. One co-culture group was not supplemented with PGRN, serving as the PGRN-untreated group (AG), while another group was supplemented with extracted PGRN, serving as the PGRN-treated group (BG). CD4+ T cells derived from the blood of healthy individuals were used as the control group (CG). Result: The serum PGRN concentration in TAO patients was visibly higher as against the CG; The contents of interleukin (IL-10), IL-4, and IL-17 in BG were visibly lower as against AG; The protein and mRNA expression of cytokines in BG were visibly lower as against AG; The proliferation level of CD4 + T cells was visibly lower, and the apoptosis level was visibly higher in BG as against AG (P < 0.05). Conclusion: PGRN may be implicated in the pathogenesis of TAO. It could modulate the immune response by reducing cytokine release in CD4+ T cell-derived exosomes, inhibiting the proliferation of CD4+ T cells, and promoting their apoptosis.",

    "abstract": "Tularemia is a zoonotic infectious disease caused by Francisella tularensis. It is transmitted by rodents and results in an infectious disease characterized by lymphadenopathy. This study aims to evaluate the role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in patients with tularemia. This prospective, case-control study was conducted between June and August 2024 at the Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology Clinics of Sivas Cumhuriyet University Hospital, Sivas, Turkey. The study included 40 patients aged 18 years and older diagnosed with tularemia. The control group comprised 30 healthy individuals. The serum levels of ER stress markers (EIF2α, GRP78, and CHOP) were compared between patients and control groups. The mean age of the patients was 44 ± 16 years, and 72.5 % (n = 29) were female. The control group had a mean age of 37 ± 12 years, and 36 % (n = 11) were female. The most common clinical form of tularemia was oropharyngeal (82.5 %, n = 33). Levels of EIF2α, GRP78, and CHOP were significantly higher in the tularemia patient group compared to the control group (p < 0.001). Although ER stress protein levels were higher in patients who did not require lymph node dissection than in those who did, the difference was not statistically significant. Additionally, no significant difference was observed in ER stress protein levels between patients who responded to treatment and those who did not. The results of this study indicate that ER stress molecules such as CHOP, EIF2α, and GRP78 exhibit significant increases during tularemia infection. These data support the role of the ER stress pathway in the pathogenesis of tularemia.",

    "abstract": "Despite the availability of multiple effective therapies for localized prostate cancer, many patients still progress to incurable metastasized castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). About 23 % of mCRPC patients carry alterations in DNA damage response (DDR) genes, including the protein kinases Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM). DDR gene mutations have been shown to increase radiosensitivity and responses to immunotherapy. Here, we aimed to investigate the effect of inhibiting ATM and Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR) on the radiosensitivity and subsequent activation of the cGAS-STING pathway in three prostate cancer cell lines. The data demonstrate that ATM and ATR inhibition leads to increased radiosensitivity in the PC3 and DU145 cell lines and that simultaneous inhibition of ATM and ATR results in enhanced cell death after irradiation. Furthermore, ATM blockade or combined ATM and ATR inhibition, but not ATR inhibition alone, significantly enhances radiation-induced cGAMP levels and a gene expression signature induced by the cytokine type I interferon. This work highlights the promising effects of ATM and ATR inhibition in combination with radiotherapy in prostate cancer and offers opportunities for exploring the use of radiotherapy and immunotherapy combinations in mCRPC.",

    "abstract": "Visceral leishmaniasis, caused by Leishmania donovani is characterized by clinicopathological features like hepatomegaly with loss of liver function, etc. Albumin is an essential parameter of liver function, performing various tasks like maintaining osmotic balance in blood vessels, preventing tissue fluid leakage, carrier properties, etc. Human VL patients and Leishmania donovani-infected hamsters (ExVL) were tested for their albumin levels. IL-10 derived from Leishmania donovani-infected monocytes and recombinant IL-10 were tested on HepG2 cells for CEBP-β and albumin expression with IL-10 blocking and JAK1/STAT3 inhibition. CEBP-β binding onto the albumin promoter and its silencing were performed to confirm its role in albumin expression. Low albumin, i.e., hypoalbuminemia, was found in visceral leishmaniasis and ExVL. Its levels were inversely associated with parasitic load and hepatic IL-10 in both models. When treated with Leishmania donovani-driven IL-10 from the infected monocytes and recombinant IL-10, there was a significant decrease in albumin expression from HepG2 cells in a JAK1/STAT3-dependent manner. To further explore the molecular mechanism behind hypoalbuminemia in Visceral leishmaniasis, CEBP-β, a transcription factor having three isoforms (LAP1, LAP2, and LIP), was shown to increase upon recombinant IL-10 treatment and bind to the D site of the albumin promoter using Chromatin immunoprecipitation PCR. shRNA silencing results confirm CEBP-β-mediated decrease in albumin levels. Our findings showed that increased hepatic IL-10 upon Leishmania donovani infection reduces albumin levels in a JAK1/STAT3 and CEBP-β-dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "Recombinant interleukin-18 (IL-18) holds promise as a therapeutic for oncology, as a robust activator of adaptive and innate immune cells and a potent producer of IFN-γ. However, clinical success has been limited due to rapid upregulation of the natural IL-18 inhibitor, IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP), and fast systemic clearance of active IL-18, unbound to IL-18BP. To overcome these limitations, human IL-18 and mouse orthologs were engineered with resistance to IL-18BP and extended half-life by fusion to an Fc scaffold, with the goal of creating an improved IL-18-based therapeutic. IL-18 variants with a range of potencies showed no detectable binding to IL-18BP and retained full biological activity in the presence of super-physiological levels of IL-18BP. Pharmacokinetic studies comparing the mouse orthologs with a “naked” IL-18BP resistant tool IL-18 variant confirmed the importance of half-life extension. Importantly, the mouse Fc orthologs exhibited stronger and more durable TH1 cytokine production and expansion of cytotoxic NK cells and effector CD8+ T cells when compared to the naked IL-18 variant. Remarkably, mouse engineered IL-18 variants administered once a week demonstrated strong tumor growth inhibition and improved survival compared to vehicle treated mice in multiple syngeneic tumor models. Human IL-18 variants dosed in humanized mice mirrored in vivo findings from mouse orthologs, displaying extended pharmacokinetics and durable upregulation of serum TH1 cytokines. These promising preclinical results highlight engineered IL-18 solutions that resist IL-18BP binding and extend half-life, unlocking its full potential for sustained anti-cancer immune responses.",

    "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) are the most common joint diseases globally, posing major public health challenges. Although they are often distinguished from each other in clinical diagnoses, we hypothesize that RA and OA could have overlapping molecular pathways. Hence, this study was designed to explore the shared molecular changes and potential therapeutic targets for RA and OA. Transcriptome data were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (GSE51588, GSE12021 and GSE55235), which included 117 synovial membrane samples (33 healthy, 50 OA, and 34 RA). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the “limma” package in R, and functional enrichment analyses were conducted using Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes frameworks. Protein-protein interaction networks were constructed through STRING, and further analyzed using GeneMANIA. Immune cell infiltration in RA and OA samples was evaluated using the CIBERSORT algorithm; microRNA-messenger RNA interactions were predicted through miRanda, miRDB, miRWalk, and TargetScan databases; and lncRNAs targets were identified via the SpongeScan database. Gene-drug interactions were analyzed using DGIdb, and the results were validated in RA and OA mouse models via immunohistochemistry and western blot. In RA and OA, 38 DEGs were identified, including 23 downregulated and 15 upregulated genes (FDR < 0.05, |log2FC| > 0), associated with key pathways such as ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, mTOR, JAK-STAT, and Wnt signaling. Hub genes, including EIF3B, KHSRP, nucleolin (NCL), PDCD1LG2, SLC25A37, demonstrated significant differential expression (p < 0.05). In addition, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis indicated good diagnostic potential, with areas under the curve (AUC) values ranging from 0.795 to 0.958. Furthermore, immune cell infiltration analysis revealed significant involvement of plasma cells, T cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells (p < 0.05). Several hub genes were targeted by existing drugs, such as NCL by AS1411, and PDCD1LG2 by Pembrolizumab. In vivo validation revealed that EIF3B, KHSRP, NCL, and PDCD1LG2 were downregulated in both RA and OA mouse models compared to controls (p < 0.01), with EIF3B exhibiting higher expression in RA than in OA (p < 0.01). Mitoferrin 1 expression showed no significant differences among groups. These findings suggest that RA and OA share common molecular pathways that may serve as promising diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Critical limb ischemia is a severe stage when hypoperfusion occurs in patients with lower extremity arteriosclerotic obliterans. Exosomes have emerged as a key therapeutic agent for lower extremity ischemia. However, how these exosomes take effects on ischemic limb is still unknown. Insulin-like growth factor II (IGF2) is a key protein responsible for guiding angiogenesis. Mouse ischemic limb was injected with phosphate buffer saline (PBS), exosomes from murine adipose-derived stem cells (ADSC-Exo) and IGF2-specific knockout of ADSC-Exo (IGF2−/−-Exo), respectively, then blood flow was detected at 21 days after injection. The level of dynamic limb movement and impairment were assessed by ambulatory impairment and tissue damage scores. Laser Doppler imaging was performed to measure the blood flow of the ischemic limbs. Molecular biology experiment is performed to investigate the mechanism of ADSC-Exo mediated limb protection against ischemia injury. Compared with the untreated group, ADSC-Exo injection significantly promoted blood perfusion of ischemic hind limbs, while knockout of IGF2 weakened the therapeutic effect of the ADSC-Exo. The fluorescence intensity of CD31+ in the IGF2−/−-Exo-treated group was lower than that in the ADSC-Exo group. Tubular structures of endothelial cells in ADSC-Exo-treated group were significantly more than those in PBS-treated group, while endothelial cells in IGF2−/−-Exo-treated group formed fewer tubular structures than those in ADSC-Exo-treated group. The protein levels of p-PI3K, p-AKT and p-eNOS in endothelial cells were upregulated by ADSC-Exo whereas IGF2-knockout impaired this promotion to activation states. Our study demonstrated that IGF2-expressing ADSC-Exo exerted a potent pro-proliferative and angiogenic effects against limb ischemia injury associated with the PI3K-Akt-eNOS pathway.",

    "title": "Characterising high-resolution dynamics of inflammatory and SCFA responses to food consumption in healthy men: A pilot biomarker discovery study",
    "abstract": "Understanding inflammatory responses after food consumption and at fasting is crucial for assessing the impact of diet on long-term health. To study these responses meaningfully, biomarkers must be responsive to food intake, consistent across individuals, and predictive of future health outcomes. Preliminary data suggest that anti-inflammatory short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), produced by the microbiota from prebiotic fibre, might be relevant biomarkers in the food-induced inflammatory reaction, but data on their timing, magnitude, dynamics at fasting and during the postprandial state, and relationship with other biomarkers are currently lacking. This knowledge gap impacts our ability to identify reliable biomarkers that can be used as surrogate outcomes in dietary interventions and research focused on reducing chronic disease risk. In this biomarker discovery study, we aimed to identify meal-responsive inflammatory biomarkers and assess plasma SCFAs pharmacokinetics following meal intake. Three healthy male participants consumed three isoenergetic meals with different theoretical pro-inflammatory potential, one per week over a three-week period: an anti-inflammatory meal (Meal A), a pro-inflammatory meal (Meal B), and a pro-inflammatory meal with a butyrate-promoting prebiotic fibre supplement (Meal C). For each meal condition, blood samples were taken continually over a 30-h period, and inflammatory cytokines and plasma SCFAs were measured. Cytokine biomarker dynamics were classified based on their response to meals. We identified 26 meal-responsive biomarkers, with three—CST5, FGF-19, and ST1A1—showing consistent postprandial changes across participants. The study also revealed significant interindividual variability, with 23 biomarkers displaying highly personalised responses to food intake. Quantitative analysis of plasma SCFA concentrations indicated non-trivial dynamics, but a clear accumulation of butyrate, acetate, and propionate in plasma during a 25-h period following meal intake. Our findings highlight the complexity of the postprandial response, emphasising the need for thoughtful consideration of study design, including the choice and sampling rate of biomarkers. The identified biomarkers offer potential for future research and clinical applications, improving the understanding of diet-induced inflammation and its role in chronic disease prevention.",

Methods: Eight recreationally endurance trained individuals (27.2 ± 3.1 years old, VO₂Peak 53.1 ± 2.1 mL/kg/min) performed a strenuous step-up/step-down protocol until exhaustion. Blood samples were collected pre and post exercise and incubated 37 °C or 40 °C during 2 h. Flow cytometry was used to assess TLR-4 expression, NF-kB activation, mitochondrial membrane potential and TNF-alpha expression in CD14+ monocytes. Results: Post exercise, TLR-4 expression and NF-kB activation increased at 37 °C (p < 0.001), but heat therapy at 40 °C significantly reduced these responses (p < 0.01). MMP decreased after exercise at both temperatures but was significantly lower at 37 °C than 40 °C (p < 0.05). TNF-a levels showed a trend toward returning to baseline with heat therapy. Conclusion: Ex vivo heat therapy reduces monocyte mediated inflammation after exercise, induced muscle damage, suggesting its potential as a recovery strategy to strenuous exercise sessions.",

    "abstract": "Due to their interesting biological activities, a mannose-binding lectin isolated from Dioclea violacea seeds, known as DvL have attracted considerable attention. In this study, we performed macroscopic, histologic, and immunohistochemical analysis on chicken embryo chorioallantoic membranes (CAM) to investigate the effects of DvL on the angiogenic process. Data showed a potential angiogenic effect of DvL at the highest concentrations tested (50 and 100 μg/mL). This effect was confirmed through increased neovascularization, inflammatory cells, and fibroblasts in histological analysis of the CAM. In addition, the immunohistochemistry of CAM showed that DvL induced secretion of TNF-α and VEGF, important cytokines involved in angiogenesis. Therefore, increased neovascularization may result from a pro-inflammatory response through VEGF and TNF-α secretion. In contrast, the DvL effects on the angiogenic process and the TNF-α and VEGF secretion were significantly reduced by co-incubation with mannose. Thus, protein-carbohydrate interactions between DvL and cell membrane glycans are likely the main events involved in this effect. Therefore, our results demonstrated that DvL is a potent angiogenic agent, suggesting its potential application as a prototype molecule for developing new drugs with healing properties.",

    "abstract": "Cocaine dysregulates tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling in mesolimbic substrates, suggesting a role for TNF in cocaine-induced hyperlocomotion, a signature preclinical effect of cocaine. Inhibition of TNF signaling by genetic deletion or with a brain-penetrable TNF antagonist enhances cocaine-induced hyperlocomotion in male mice, but roles for sex and peripheral TNF are unclear. Also unknown is how peripherally restricted etanercept, the world's most widely prescribed TNF inhibitor, affects cocaine-induced locomotor responses. We determined effects of etanercept on a triad of cocaine-induced locomotor responses (e.g., ambulation, stereotypy, distance traveled) in male and female rats and impacts of etanercept-cocaine exposure on tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine transporter (DAT) mRNA levels in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Etanercept (20 mg/kg, IP) and a submaximal dose of cocaine (10 mg/kg, IP) were used initially, and etanercept was injected 48 h before cocaine to capture peak plasma concentrations. Etanercept itself did not affect spontaneous locomotor responses in male or female rats. In male rats, etanercept increased cocaine-induced ambulatory and stereotypical activities and enhanced cocaine-induced distance traveled. Etanercept modestly reduced TH mRNA levels in the VTA of cocaine-naïve and cocaine treated male rats. Locomotor responses in male rats that were evoked by a higher dose of cocaine (20 mg/kg, IP) were not affected by etanercept. In female rats, etanercept did not affect any cocaine-induced locomotor responses. These results show that etanercept exerts effects on locomotor behaviors induced by cocaine that depend on both sex and cocaine dose and suggest that peripheral inhibition of TNF influences cocaine-induced behaviors.

    "abstract": "This study explored the mechanism by which glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1) promotes neutrophil extracellular trap (NET)-mediated macrophage phenotype conversion in a high-glucose environment, based on the interaction between fibroblasts and macrophages. We demonstrated that GLUT1 plays an important role in immune cell–fibroblast crosstalk. High glucose induces GLUT1 to upregulate high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) levels, thereby promoting NET release and macrophage M1 polarization. Addition of a NET inhibitor promoted macrophage M2 polarization and alleviated the impaired macrophage phenotype conversion. Additionally, overexpression of Glut1 enhanced the expression of inflammatory factors tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin beta (IL-1β), leading to inflammatory damage to fibroblasts, which was reversed significantly by inhibiting NETs . The results indicated that GLUT1 mediates the crosstalk between NETs, macrophage phenotype conversion impairment, and inflammatory damage in fibroblasts. This study emphasizes the importance of GLUT1 in the interaction between immune cells and fibroblasts, and its regulatory role in the impairment of NET-mediated macrophage phenotype conversion. These findings suggest that the regulatory mechanisms between HMGB1 and NETs in a high-glucose environment might provide potential therapeutic targets to treat diabetic wounds.",

    "abstract": "Mastitis is an important disease of the mammary gland in all kinds of lactating mammals, endangering the development of animal husbandry and human health. Apigenin is one chemical constituent of Taraxacum and Philippine Violet Herb which are effective Chinese herbs for the treatment of mastitis. It is reported that apigenin possesses anti-inflammatory activity and other pharmacological effects. However, the attenuation of apigenin on mastitis has not yet been reported. The present study investigated the protection of apigenin against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mastitis in SD rats both in vivo and in vitro. The results suggested that apigenin relieved the lesions of mammary tissues induced by LPS, decreased mRNA and protein levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines:tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Simultaneously, apigenin reduced the increasing content of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) induced by LPS. The results showed that apigenin was able to attenuate the LPS-induced mastitis in rats by inhibiting the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway in vivo and in vitro, which provides scientific references for further research.",

    "title": "Augmented hippocampal up-regulation of immune modulators following a peripheral immune challenge in a hemizygous mouse model of the 15q13.3 microdeletion",
    "abstract": "The strongest known genetic risk factor for generalized epilepsy is the human hemizygous 15q13.3 microdeletion (MD). This 1.5 Mb MD encompasses six genes, including CHRNA7 encoding the alpha7 subunit that forms the homo-pentameric nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, a known regulator of the immune system. In the CNS, hyper activation of neuroimmune responses contributes to increased seizure susceptibility. In a mouse model with a hemizygous deletion of the orthologous region (Df(h15q13)/+) (Het), we previously demonstrated increased hippocampal expression of inflammatory cytokines compared to wildtype (WT) mice following a mild peripheral immune challenge. To further characterize neuroimmune responses, hippocampal mRNA expression of the chemokines CXCL2 and CXCL10, and the Gap junction protein connexin 43 (GJA1), all of which are implicated in neuronal hyperexcitability, were determined along with additional immune related targets. Three hours after a lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0.1 mg/kg) or polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly(I:C), 5 mg/kg) injection (i.p.), hippocampi were collected, mRNA extracted, and cDNA prepared for qPCR. The results demonstrate extensive upregulation of CXCL2 and CXCL10 expression by LPS and Poly(I:C) (up to 200-fold CXCL2, up to 600-fold CXCL10) (p < 0.0001) with genotype x treatment interactions for CXCL2 by LPS (p < 0.007). Responses to treatment were far smaller in magnitude for all other targets. LPS and Poly(I:C) induced statistically similar increases for Toll-like receptor (TLR)2, TLR4, HMGB1, and C3, but Poly(I:C) had stronger effects on GJA1, TLR3, C1qA and MARCO expression. Remarkably, TLR3 was the only target with significant downregulation of expression after Poly(I:C) (p < 0.0001). In addition, genotype x treatment interactions were detected for TLR3, TLR4, HMGB1, and C1qA (p < 0.02). Thus, a peripheral immune challenge caused extensive increases for CXCL2 and CXCL10, and the genotype-treatment interactions that was seen for several targets, underscored the augmented neuroinflammatory response in mice carrying the MD. Of note is the dramatic upregulation of CXCL10 by low dose Poly(I:C). CXCL10 causes hyperexcitability via neuronal CXCR3 activation. Thus, even an asymptomatic viral infection may increase seizure susceptibility. In summary, a peripheral immune challenge causes strong upregulation of hippocampal inflammatory mediators implicated in neuronal excitability which is particularly detrimental for individuals with high seizure susceptibility, such as carriers of the 15q13.3 MD.",

    "abstract": "This study employs transcriptomics and single-cell analysis to delve into the mechanisms by which damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) trigger immune activation in coronary artery disease (CAD). We obtained RNA-seq data from the GSE202625 and GSE242046 datasets, as well as single-cell RNA-seq data from the GSE159677 dataset, all sourced from the GEO database. Through differential expression analysis, we identified 821 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), comprising 389 upregulated and 432 downregulated genes, which are likely closely associated with the pathological processes of CAD. Notably, the genes P2RY14 and IFIH1 exhibited significant expression differences in CAD, suggesting their potential involvement in immune responses and inflammatory processes. Our findings indicate a significant infiltration and activation of immune cells in CAD patients, particularly T cells and macrophages. The activation of these cells is likely linked to the release of DAMPs and the activation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), thereby triggering local and systemic inflammatory responses. Single-cell analysis further revealed distinct clustering patterns of immune cells, especially T cells and B cells, in CAD patients compared to healthy controls. Dendritic cells and macrophages play particularly critical roles in the development of CAD. Dendritic cells bridge innate and adaptive immune responses by presenting antigens to T lymphocytes, potentially either promoting or inhibiting the progression of atherosclerosis. Macrophages exhibit polarization during the atherosclerosis process, with M1-type macrophages tending to promote inflammatory responses, while M2-type macrophages may exert anti-inflammatory effects.",

However, the pathophysiological significance of MDSCs in sepsis-induced immunosuppression remains to be fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the dynamic changes in MDSCs during sepsis and their contribution to sepsis-induced immunosuppression using a clinically relevant “two-hit” sepsis model. Our findings revealed that mice surviving cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) exhibited a significant accumulation and enhanced activity of MDSCs, which correlated with sepsis-related immune paralysis, impaired bacterial clearance, and heightened susceptibility to secondary infections. Importantly, administration of the liver X receptor (LXR) agonist GW3965 at the late stage of sepsis significantly restored immune function, decreased susceptibility to secondary infections, enhanced bacterial clearance, and improved prognosis by eliminating MDSCs. These results highlight the pivotal role of MDSCs in the development of sepsis-associated immunosuppression and indicate that targeting MDSCs could be a promising therapeutic approach to mitigate immunosuppression in sepsis.",

It is currently believed that the development of HSP involves abnormalities in humoral immunity and cellular immunity. The intestinal microbiota has a powerful regulatory effect on the human immune system and has been shown to serve a significant role in the pathogenesis of various immune-mediated disorders. This study examines changes in intestinal flora and cytokines(IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-17) in children with HSP and explores their correlation, offering fresh insights for the prevention and treatment of HSP. METHODS: Blood and stool specimens were collected from 25 healthy children (control group) and 27 children with HSP (observation group). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA) was used to detect the levels of cytokines IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-17, and IL-10 in the serum of all the study participants, and the 16S rRNA gene sequencing combined with high-throughput sequencing technology was used to analyze the intestinal flora of the study subjects. Finally, the correlation between serum cytokines and gut microbiota was analyzed in the children with HSP. RESULT:1)The serum levels of IL-4 and IL-17 in the observation group were higher than those in the control group, while the levels of IFN-γ and IL-10 were lower than those in the control group. 2) At the level of phylum, the abundance of Fusobacteria and Verrucomicrobia was higher than that in the control group, while the abundance of Firmicutes was lower than that of the control group, and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05); At the level of genus, the abundance of Prevotella and Akkermansia were higher than the control group, while the abundance of Bifidobacterium, Blautia, and Clostridium XlVa was lower than that in the control group, and the differences were all statistically significant (P < 0.05); At the species level, the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila, Prevotella copri, and Subdoligranulum variabile was higher than that of the control group, while the abundance of Bifidobacterium pseudolongum, Brautella Weiss, and Bacteroides fragilis was lower than that in the control group, and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). 3) The abundance of Blautia and Blautia wexlerae in the observation group was positively associated with the IL-10 level (r = 0.522, r = 0.578, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Disturbances in intestinal flora and changes in serum cytokines IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-17 were present in children with HSP.

    "abstract": "The transition of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) from vegetative growth to flowering, a key step of angiosperm reproductive success, is highly vulnerable to heat stress. Overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a hallmark of such environmental stresses, but how SAM exploits the extra ROS to achieve heat-stress resilience is largely unknown. Here, we report that tomato plants respond to heat-induced ROS burst by slowing down SAM maturation and lengthening the vegetative state to achieve heat resilience. Heat-induced extra ROS prolonged the transcriptional condensation status of TERMINATING FLOWER (TMF), a prion-like transcription repressor that undergoes phase separation by sensing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), therefore temporarily delaying activation of flowering transition and extending vegetative growth. Loss-of-function of TMF, or base editing of a single cysteine residue that senses H2O2, abolishes heat resilience. Our findings demonstrate that transcriptional reprogramming triggered by ROS might be a molecular basis of plant developmental plasticity underlying heat-stress resilience.",

    "title": "VRN2-PRC2 facilitates light-triggered repression of PIF signaling to coordinate growth in Arabidopsis",
    "abstract": "VERNALIZATION2 (VRN2) is a flowering plant-specific subunit of the polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2), a conserved eukaryotic holoenzyme that represses gene expression by depositing the histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) mark in chromatin. Previous work established VRN2 as an oxygen-regulated target of the N-degron pathway that may function as a sensor subunit connecting PRC2 activity to the perception of endogenous and environmental cues. Here, we show that VRN2 is enriched in the hypoxic shoot apex and emerging leaves of Arabidopsis, where it negatively regulates growth by establishing a stable and conditionally repressed chromatin state in key PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR (PIF)-regulated genes that promote cell expansion. This function is required to keep these genes poised for repression via a light-responsive signaling cascade later in leaf development. Thus, we identify VRN2-PRC2 as a core component of a developmentally and spatially encoded epigenetic mechanism that coordinates plant growth through facilitating the signal-dependent suppression of PIF signaling.",

    "abstract": "Organelles are defining features of eukaryotic cells, yet much remains to be learned about organelle biogenesis. Lipid droplets and peroxisomes, which play opposing roles in storing and catabolizing fats, form from a mysterious domain in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We used live-cell fluorescence microscopy to visualize peroxisome and lipid droplet biogenesis in young Arabidopsis seedlings, where lipid catabolism is active, and peroxisomes can be unusually large. We found that the ER domains where these organelles are born, which we term ER nests, are complex, dynamic structures that exclude general ER proteins but accumulate other proteins, including lipid biosynthetic enzymes and the COPII component SAR1. Furthermore, ER nests appear to define peroxisome-lipid droplet contact sites. Our findings provide a framework for understanding how these domains form and sort their protein components, illuminate eukaryotic lipid biosynthesis, and elucidate how distinct organelles arise from the ER.",

    "abstract": "Phytobacteria release type 3 effectors (T3Es) abundant in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) to undermine plant defenses. How flexible IDRs contribute to T3Es’ function in subverting plant immunity remains unclear. Here, we identify a plant plasma membrane (PM)-associated macromolecular condensation mechanism that governs the sophisticated interplay between T3E XopR and the plant’s Resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola 1 (RPM1)-interacting protein 4 (RIN4) immune complex. Upon deployment into plants, XopR undergoes PM association, percolation clustering, and spanning networking on the PM, ranging from subnanomolar to tens of nanomolar. This spatiotemporal building of the XopR network enables an efficient manipulation of plant surface immune regulators, including a coiled-coil nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptor (CNL)-guardee complex with highly disordered RIN4. When XopR hijacks and fluidizes the RIN4-RPM1 condensates, Arabidopsis shows reduced RIN4 phosphorylation and diminished RPM1-activated defense in vivo, consistent with XopR-impaired RIN4 phosphorylation by RPM1-interacting protein kinase (RIPK). Our research illuminates the mechanism underlying the dynamic interplay between bacterial T3Es and plant receptor complex condensates during infection.",

In this study, we elucidate the molecular mechanism by which kinesin family member 2C (KIF2C), a well-known microtubule depolymerase, contributes to the development of chemoresistance in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We observed elevated levels of KIF2C, tubulin tyrosination, and polyglutamylation in human and mouse breast cancer cells resistant to paclitaxel. Additionally, these chemoresistant cells possessed cross-resistance to diverse microtubule-targeting agents (MTAs). We demonstrated that KIF2C preferentially depolymerizes polyglutamylated tubulin, even in the presence of paclitaxel. To counter this, we developed 7S9, a chemical inhibitor of KIF2C, that prohibits the dissociation of KIF2C from microtubules. The combination of 7S9 and paclitaxel significantly reduced tumorigenesis in chemoresistant TNBC model in mice. Moreover, 7S9 diminished cancer cell chemoresistance to several clinically available MTAs. Our findings elucidate the molecular mechanism of KIF2C-mediated chemoresistance and highlight KIF2C as a promising target for combating cross-resistance in TNBC.",

    "abstract": "Exosomes play pleiotropic tumor-promoting functions and are secreted by fusion of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) with the plasma membrane. However, MVBs are also directed to lysosomes for degradation, and the mechanism controlling different fates of MVBs remains elusive. Here, we show that the pro-tumor protein WDR4 enhances exosome secretion from mouse and human cancer cells through degrading the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-associated Bro1-family protein PTPN23. Mechanistically, PTPN23 and ALIX compete for binding to syntenin, thereby directing MVBs toward degradation and secretion, respectively. ALIX, but not PTPN23, recruits actin-capping proteins CAPZA1/CAPZB to prevent branched filamentous actin (F-actin) accumulation around MVBs, thus enabling MVBs trafficking to the cell periphery for secretion. Functionally, WDR4/ALIX-dependent exosomes load a set of pro-tumor proteins through LAMP2A, thereby potentiating metastasis and immune evasion in mice. Our study highlights a previously unappreciated coupling between the biogenesis mechanism and the fate decision of MVBs and its importance in determining exosomal cargos, which have a profound impact on tumor progression.",

Although basement membranes are repaired after damage, little is known about repair, including whether and how damage is detected, what cells repair the damage, and how repair is controlled to avoid fibrosis. Using the intestinal basement membrane of adult Drosophila as a model, we show that after basement membrane damage, there is a sharp increase in enteroblasts transiently expressing Col4, termed “matrix mender” cells. Enteroblast-derived Col4 is specifically required for matrix repair. The increase in matrix mender cells requires the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo, expressed in intestinal stem cells. Matrix menders are induced by the loss of matrix stiffness, as specifically inhibiting Col4 crosslinking is sufficient for Piezo-dependent induction of matrix mender cells. Our data suggest that epithelial stem cells control basement membrane integrity by monitoring stiffness.",

    "abstract": "The cerebral cortex comprises diverse types of glutamatergic projection neurons (PNs) generated from radial glial progenitors (RGs) through either direct neurogenesis (dNG) or indirect neurogenesis (iNG) via intermediate progenitors (IPs). A foundational concept in corticogenesis is the “inside-out” model, whereby successive generations of PNs sequentially migrate first to deep and then progressively to more superficial layers. However, its biological significance remains unclear, and the role of iNG in this process is unknown. Using genetic strategies linking PN birth dating to projection mapping in mice, we found that the laminar deployment of IP-derived PNs substantially deviates from a stringent inside-out rule: PNs destined to non-consecutive layers are generated at the same time, and different PN types of the same layer are generated at non-contiguous times. The overarching scheme of iNG is the sequential specification and precise laminar deployment of projection-defined PN types, which may contribute to the orderly assembly of cortical output channels and processing streams.",

Here, we show that glutamine binds to heat shock cognate protein 70 (HSC70) to stimulate the deubiquitinase otubain domain containing protein (OTUD4) independently of known glutamine metabolic or signaling pathways, resulting in lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) stabilization via the microautophagy-lysosome pathway, increased lactate production and decreased expression of interferon (IFN)-β and its targets, hallmarks of immunogenic cell death (ICD). In cancer cell lines and patient-derived organoids and xenografts, glutamine depletion or glutamine transport inhibition combined with ICD-inducing chemotherapeutic drugs synergistically activates IFN-β, promotes CD8+ T cell recruitment, and inhibits cancer cell growth via the OTUD4/LDHA axis. CD8 expression is negatively correlated with expression of the glutamine transporter alanine/serine/cysteine transporter 2 (ASCT2), OTUD4, and LDHA in cancer patients. Thus, we identify an intracellular glutamine signaling pathway, and targeting this pathway is a promising strategy for cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "BRAFV600E mutant melanomas treated with BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) and MEK inhibitor (MEKi) almost invariably develop drug resistance, accompanied by restored glucose metabolism. How resumed glycolysis controls acquired resistance remains unknown. Here, we identify that lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) lactylation, induced by re-accumulated lactate in both human and murine BRAFi/MEKi-resistant melanoma cells, selectively drives survival via epigenetic reprogramming. Mechanistically, lactylation of LSD1 promotes its interaction with Fos-related antigen 1 (FosL1), preventing its degradation by E3 ligase tripartite-motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21) and selectively enhancing its genomic enrichment. We further demonstrate that lactylated LSD1 co-directs gene transcription with FosL1 to repress ferroptosis via interfering with transferrin receptor protein 1 (TFRC)-mediated iron uptake. LSD1 inhibition activates ferroptosis, resulting in drastic regression of drug-resistant murine melanoma when combined with immunotherapy. Our results highlight a crucial role of metabolic rewiring-induced epigenetic reprogramming as a bypass resistance mechanism in BRAFi/MEKi-resistant melanoma, providing a therapeutically actionable strategy to overcome resistance to targeted therapy and immunotherapy.",

Using time-resolved single-cell chromatin accessibility analysis, we delineated the regulatory profile during mouse gastruloid development, identifying critical drivers of developmental transitions. Gastruloids develop from bipotent progenitor cells driven by the transcription factors (TFs) OCT4, SOX2, and TBXT, differentiating into the mesoderm (characterized by the mesogenin 1 [MSGN1]) and spinal cord (characterized by CDX2). ΔCDX gastruloids fail to form spinal cord, while Msgn1 ablation inhibits paraxial mesoderm and spinal cord development.

The master regulator of FT, CONSTANS (CO), is essential for FLP1 expression, suggesting that FLP1 is involved in the photoperiod pathway. We show that FLP1 promotes early flowering independently of FT, is active in the shoot apical meristem, and induces the expression of SEPALLATA3 (SEP3), a key E-class homeotic gene. Unlike FT, FLP1 also facilitates inflorescence stem elongation. Our cumulative evidence suggests that the small FLP1 protein acts as a mobile signal like FT.

We tested whether perturbing a domain with multiple developmental regulators would lead to more severe outcomes. We chose a domain with three FGF ligand genes—Fgf3, Fgf4, and Fgf15—that control different murine developmental processes. Heterozygous deletion of a 23.9-kb boundary defined by four CTCF sites led to ectopic interactions of the FGF genes with enhancers active in the brain and induced FGF expression. This caused orofacial clefts, encephalocele, and fully penetrant perinatal lethality. Loss of the single CTCF motif oriented toward the enhancers—but not the three toward the FGF genes—recapitulated these phenotypes.

    "title": "Innate immune training of osteoclastogenesis promotes inflammatory bone loss in mice",
    "abstract": "We previously demonstrated that long-term trained immunity (TRIM) involves adaptations that imprint innate immune memory in long-lived myelopoiesis precursors and their progeny, monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils, which thereby acquire enhanced responsiveness to future challenges. Here, we show that a distinct component of myeloid biology, osteoclastogenesis, can also undergo innate immune training. Indeed, β-glucan-induced TRIM was associated with an increased osteoclastogenesis bias in the bone marrow and an expansion of monocytes/osteoclast progenitors in the periphery, resulting in aggravated severity of experimental periodontitis and arthritis. In the setting of trained inflammatory osteoclastogenesis, we observed transcriptomic rewiring in synovial myeloid cells of arthritic mice, featuring prominent upregulation of the transcription factor melanogenesis-associated transcription factor (MITF). Adoptive transfer of splenic monocytes from β-glucan-trained mice to naive recipients exacerbated arthritis in the latter in a strictly MITF-dependent manner. Our findings establish trained osteoclastogenesis as a maladaptive component of TRIM and potentially provide therapeutic targets in inflammatory bone loss disorders.",

    "abstract": "A central question in cell and developmental biology is how extracellular cues control the differentiation of multipotent progenitors in a dynamically changing niche. Here, we identify apical-basal polarity as the main regulator of the differentiation of multipotent pancreatic Neurogenin3+ endocrine progenitors (EPs) into the beta or alpha cell fates. We show that human EPs dynamically change their apical-basal polarity status. Whereas polarized EPs are predisposed to differentiate into beta cells rather than alpha cells, inhibiting apical-basal polarity selectively suppresses beta cell differentiation. Single-cell RNA sequencing and complementary mechanistic data demonstrate that apical-basal polarity in human EPs promotes beta cell specification via cyclic AMP (cAMP)/PKA-cAMP response element binding protein (CREB)-EGR1-mediated inhibition of ARX expression, while reduced cAMP levels in non-polarized human EPs maintain expression of ARX, leading to alpha cell differentiation. These findings identify the apical-basal polarity status of multipotent EPs as a critical epithelial feature that determines their fate into the alpha or beta cell lineages.",

We identified distinct cell clusters representing major cell types of the P. patens gametophyte, including the gametophore apical cells. We showed dynamic gene expression changes during cell fate progression in the gametophore apical cell and found upregulation of cytokinin biosynthesis genes in this cell. We also identified ENHANCER OF SHOOT REGENERATION 1 (ESR1) orthologs as important regulators of gametophore apical cells downstream of cytokinin.

We created a comprehensive single-cell atlas of over 1.3 million cells from the telencephalon and cerebellum of turtles, zebra finches, pigeons, mice, and macaques, employing single-cell resolution spatial transcriptomics to validate gene expression patterns across species. Our study identifies significant species-specific variations in cell types, highlighting their conservation and diversification in evolution. We found pronounced differences in telencephalon excitatory neurons (EXs) and cerebellar cell types between birds and mammals. Birds predominantly express SLC17A6 in EX, whereas mammals express SLC17A7 in the neocortex and SLC17A6 elsewhere, possibly due to loss of function of SLC17A7 in birds. Additionally, we identified a bird-specific Purkinje cell subtype (SVIL+), implicating the lysine-specific demethylase 11 (LSD1)/KDM1A pathway in learning and circadian rhythms and containing numerous positively selected genes, which suggests an evolutionary optimization of cerebellar functions for ecological and behavioral adaptation.

Our results show that TGF-β signaling modulates neural crest axial identity and directly controls the gene circuits that support skeletal differentiation. Cooperation between TGF-β and low levels of WNT signaling in the embryonic head activates cranial-specific cis-regulatory elements. Activation of TGF-β signaling reprogrammed trunk neural crest cells into adopting an anterior identity and led to the development of an improved protocol for the generation of human cranial neural crest cells.

However, the function and regulatory mechanisms of NLRs during Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) infection in wheat remain elusive. Here, we identify an ankyrin (ANK) repeat and tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)-containing protein, TaANK-TPR1, which plays a positive role in the regulation of wheat resistance against Pst and the immune response of NLR. TaANK-TPR1 targets the NLR protein TaRPP13L1 (Recognition of Peronospora Parasitica 13-like 1) to facilitate its homodimerization and cell death to enhance the resistance of wheat against Pst. Meanwhile, TaANK-TPR1 binds to the TGACGT motif (methyl jasmonate-responsive element) of the TaRPP13L1 promoter and activates TaRPP13L1 transcription. Both TaANK-TPR1 and TaRPP13L1 respond to jasmonic acid (JA) signaling via the TGACGT element.

We show that undegraded paternal mitochondria in autophagy-deficient C. elegans embryos are gradually excluded from germ blastomeres through asymmetric partitioning during cell divisions. The embryonic cortical flow drives anterior-directed movements of paternal mitochondria and contributes to their asymmetric apportioning between two daughter blastomeres. By contrast, autophagosome-enclosed paternal mitochondria cluster around and segregate with centrosomes during mitosis and are rapidly degraded through lysosomes concentrated near centrosomes. Failure to exclude persistent paternal mitochondria from the germ blastomere at first cleavage causes their enrichment in the descendant endomesodermal (EMS) blastomere, leading to elevated reactive oxygen species levels, elongated EMS lineage durations, and increased embryonic lethality, which antioxidant treatments can suppress. Thus, regulated paternal mitochondrial distribution away from germ blastomeres is a fail-safe mechanism, protecting embryo development and maternal mitochondrial inheritance.",

Mechanical compression-induced calcium influx activates myosin II in “loser” cells, leading to apoptotic nuclear breakdown and subsequent clearance. N-cadherin/Rac1/PAK1/myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK)-controlled myosin II inactivation endows cells with resistance to mechanical stress and superior cellular flexibility, thus providing a cell competition advantage to self-seeded cells.

Early embryos thus consist of many pairs of sister cells connected by stable cytokinetic bridges that allow them to share diffusible molecules. We show that apoptotic regulators are shared through cytokinetic bridges and that these bridges ensure that if one cell enters apoptosis, its sister cell does as well.

    "abstract": "Distinguishing tumor maintenance genes from initiation, progression, and passenger genes is critical for developing effective therapies. We employed a functional genomic approach using the Lazy Piggy transposon to identify tumor maintenance genes in vivo and applied this to sonic hedgehog (SHH) medulloblastoma (MB). Combining Lazy Piggy screening in mice and transcriptomic profiling of human MB, we identified the voltage-gated potassium channel KCNB2 as a candidate maintenance driver. KCNB2 governs cell volume of MB-propagating cells (MPCs), with KCNB2 depletion causing osmotic swelling, decreased plasma membrane tension, and elevated endocytic internalization of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), thereby mitigating proliferation of MPCs to ultimately impair MB growth. KCNB2 is largely dispensable for mouse development and KCNB2 knockout synergizes with anti-SHH therapy in treating MB. These results demonstrate the utility of the Lazy Piggy functional genomic approach in identifying cancer maintenance drivers and elucidate a mechanism by which potassium homeostasis integrates biomechanical and biochemical signaling to promote MB aggression.",

Here, we show that this behavior does not require proteins with specific polymerase activity. Specifically, condensates composed of Lamellipodin, a protein that binds actin but is not an actin polymerase, were also capable of assembling actin filaments. To probe the minimum requirements for condensate-mediated actin bundling, we developed an agent-based computational model. Guided by its predictions, we hypothesized that any condensate-forming protein that binds filamentous actin could bundle filaments through multivalent crosslinking. To test this, we added a filamentous-actin-binding motif to Eps15, a condensate-forming protein that does not normally bind actin. The resulting chimera formed condensates that facilitated efficient assembly and bundling of actin filaments. Collectively, these findings broaden the family of proteins that could organize cytoskeletal filaments to include any filamentous-actin-binding protein that participates in protein condensation.",

Individual gene knockdowns of ATL3 and RTN3 inhibit ER-TB formation and the UPS of trafficking-deficient ΔF508-CFTR. Combined supplementation of ATL3 and RTN3L induces ER-TB formation and UPS. ATL3 also participates in the SARS-CoV-2-associated convoluted membrane formation and Golgi-independent trafficking of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

Lung c-Kit+ cells increase in pulmonary hypertension patients and in the SU5416/hypoxia (SuHx)-induced PVR mouse model. Employing genetic lineage tracing and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we elucidate that lung-resident c-Kit+ cells display an aerocyte and venular endothelial differentiation in the SuHx model. Ablation of tissue-resident c-Kit+ cells exacerbates PVR. We identify an Nr2f2-expressing c-Kit+ cell subgroup, which exhibitsvenous EC differentiation and increases during PVR. Notably, the elevation of Nr2f2 in c-Kit+ cells via AAV enhances differentiation and mitigates PVR.

Canonical Wnt signaling is essential for proper CNS vascularization and barrier maintenance.

Endothelium-specific Usp9x knockout mice exhibit reduced Wnt-signaling activity, compromising CNS vascularization and barrier function during development. Activation of Wnt signaling rescues these defects. Mechanistically, we identified β-catenin as a direct substrate of USP9X, with USP9X catalyzing K48 polyubiquitin chains to stabilize β-catenin. In pathological mouse models of impaired CNS vascular barrier function, including intracerebral hemorrhage and an oxygen-induced retinopathy, loss of Usp9x intensifies barrier disruption, accentuating defects.

We identify dietary amino acid ratios optimal for developmental speed but show that they compromise survival unless vitamins and sterols are co-optimized. Rapid development on HolFast is not improved by adding fatty acids, but it is dependent upon their de novo synthesis in the fat body via fatty acid synthase (FASN). HolFast outperforms other holidic diets, supporting rates of growth and development close to those of yeast-based diets and, under germ-free conditions, identical.

We found that disrupting TORC1 signaling in Drosophila embryos prevented cell volume increases and slowed down wound repair. Catabolic processes, such as autophagy, can inhibit cell growth. Five-dimensional microscopy demonstrated that the number of autophagosomes decreased during wound repair, suggesting that autophagy must be tightly regulated for rapid wound healing. mTor inhibition increased autophagy, and activating autophagy prevented cell volume expansion and slowed down wound closure.

DYRK1A directly phosphorylates SMAD3 Thr132, thereby suppressing the negative impact of TGF-β signaling on transcription of SLC1A5, leading to intrinsic resistance of liver cancer cells to OXPHOS inhibition. Moreover, we demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy of IACS-010759 in combination with DYRK1A inhibition in multiple liver cancer models, including xenografts, patient-derived xenografts, and spontaneous tumor model. Our study elucidates how the DYRK1A-TGF-β signaling axis controls the response of tumor cells to OXPHOS inhibition and provides valuable insights into targeting OXPHOS for liver cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "The 5′ UTRs of mRNAs are critical for translation regulation during development, but their in vivo regulatory features are poorly characterized. Here, we report the regulatory landscape of 5′ UTRs during early zebrafish embryogenesis using a massively parallel reporter assay of 18,154 sequences coupled to polysome profiling. We found that the 5′ UTR suffices to confer temporal dynamics to translation initiation and identified 86 motifs enriched in 5′ UTRs with distinct ribosome recruitment capabilities. A quantitative deep learning model, Danio Optimus 5-Prime (DaniO5P), identified a combined role for 5′ UTR length, translation initiation site context, upstream AUGs, and sequence motifs on ribosome recruitment. DaniO5P predicts the activities of maternal and zygotic 5′ UTR isoforms and indicates that modulating 5′ UTR length and motif grammar contributes to translation initiation dynamics. This study provides a first quantitative model of 5′ UTR-based translation regulation in development and lays the foundation for identifying the underlying molecular effectors.",

    "abstract": "The intestinal epithelium has a remarkably high turnover in homeostasis. It remains unresolved how this is orchestrated at the cellular level and how the behavior of stem and progenitor cells ensures tissue maintenance. To address this, we combined quantitative fate mapping in three complementary mouse models with mathematical modeling and single-cell RNA sequencing. Our integrated approach generated a spatially and temporally defined model of crypt maintenance based on two cycling populations: stem cells at the crypt-bottom and transit-amplifying (TA) cells above them. Subsequently, we validated the predictions from the mathematical model, demonstrating that fate decisions between the secretory and absorptive lineages are made within the stem cell compartment, whereas TA cell divisions contribute specifically to the absorptive lineage. These quantitative insights provide further direct evidence for crypt-bottom stem cells as the dominant driver of the intestinal epithelium replenishment.",

However, the underlying mechanisms and regulators remain unclear. Here, by performing allelic transcriptome analysis on human preimplantation embryos, we accurately quantified MZT progression by allelic ratio and identified a fraction of 8-cell embryos, at the appropriate developmental time point and exhibiting normal morphology, were in transcriptionally arrested status. Furthermore, we identified PAIRED (PRD)-like homeobox transcription factors divergent paired-related homeobox (DPRX) and arginine-fifty homeobox (ARGFX) as factors involved in MZT, whose deficiency severely impairs MZT and lineage specification and leads to aberrant retention of histone acetylation. By reversing the acetylation retention caused by DPRX and ARGFX defects, embryonic arrest can be partially rescued. Our study identifies factors involved in human MZT and elucidates the etiology underlying human cleavage-stage arrest.",

    "abstract": "Golgi abnormalities have been linked to aging and age-related diseases, yet the underlying causes and functional consequences remain poorly understood. This study identifies the interaction between age-associated zinc deficiency and Golgi stress as a critical factor in cellular aging. Senescent Golgi bodies from human fibroblasts show a fragmented Golgi structure, associated with a decreased interaction of the zinc-dependent Golgi-stacking protein complex Golgin45-GRASP55. Golgi stress is increased, and functions such as glycosylation and vesicle transport are impaired. These disturbances promote Golgi and perinuclear microtubule disassembly and subsequent mislocalization of intracellular proteins associated with cellular signaling and epigenetic control. Pharmacological induction of Golgi stress or zinc deficiency, or ablation of the Golgi-associated zinc transporter gene Zip13 in mouse fibroblasts, replicate the characteristics of cellular senescence, emphasizing the critical role of Golgi-zinc homeostasis. These findings highlight the importance of adequate zinc intake and suggest targeting Golgi dysfunction as a therapeutic strategy for alleviating age-related cellular decline.",

    "abstract": "Female primordial germ cells (PGCs) undergo X chromosome reactivation (XCR) during genome-wide reprogramming. XCR kinetics and dynamics are poorly understood at a molecular level. Here, we apply single-cell RNA sequencing and chromatin profiling on germ cells from F1 mouse embryos, performing a precise appraisal of XCR spanning from migratory-stage PGCs to gonadal germ cells. Establishment of germ cell sexual dimorphism and X chromosome dosage compensation states in vivo are temporally linked to XCR. Allele-specific analysis evidence that the reactivating X chromosome is minimally active in embryonic day (E)9.5 female PGCs, reactivates gradually, and reaches parity to the active X chromosome in E16.5 oogonia. While Xist is repressed from E10.5 onward, epigenetic memory of X inactivation persists from self-sustained polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) activity. The reactivating X is asymmetrically enriched for histone 3-lysine-27-trimethylation (H3K27me3) at E13.5, which is later reversed, permitting germline gene expression. Our findings relate XCR with PRC2 function in promoting female meiosis.",

    "title": "PCP-B peptides and CrRLK1L receptor kinases control pollination via pH gating of aquaporins in Arabidopsis",
    "abstract": "During pollen-stigma interaction, pollen coat protein B-class peptides (PCP-Bs) compete with stigmatic rapid alkalinization factor (RALF) for interaction with FERONIA/ANJEA receptor kinases (FER/ANJ), stimulating pollen hydration and germination. However, the molecular mechanism underlying PCP-Bs-induced, FER/ANJ-regulated compatible responses remains largely unknown. Through PCP-Bγ-induced phosphoproteomic analysis, we characterized a series of pollination-related signaling pathways regulated by FER/ANJ. Interestingly, on stigmatic papillary cells, pollen PCP-Bγ induced an elevation in cytosolic pH near the plasma membrane (PM), sustained by stigmatic RALF23/33 through regulation of the autoinhibited H+-ATPase 1/2 (AHA1/2) activity. We further found that RALFs/PCP-Bs and FER/ANJ regulated the pH alterations via phosphorylation of AHA1/2 C terminus. Furthermore, RALF23/33–FER/ANJ maintained the protonation of H197 in plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs), whereas PCP-B relieved the protonation through AHA activity. Altogether, this study reveals that pollen PCP-Bs trigger FER/ANJ-controlled compatible responses, particularly the opening of aquaporins via AHA-mediated pH changes, thereby facilitating pollen hydration in Arabidopsis.",

The molecular basis of these innovations often involves the emergence of new genes or establishing new connections between conserved elements, though evidence for evolutionary genetic circuit rewiring remains scarce. Here, we show that the thermospermine-dependent pathway regulating vascular cell proliferation in Arabidopsis thaliana operates as two distinct modules with different functions in the bryophyte Marchantia polymorpha. One module controls dichotomous branching at meristems, while the other one modulates gemmae and rhizoid production in the thallus. Heterologous assays and comparative expression analyses reveal that the molecular links between these modules, forming a unified circuit in vascular plants, emerged early in tracheophyte evolution. Our results illustrate how the thermospermine-dependent circuit elements followed two divergent evolutionary trajectories in bryophytes and tracheophytes, eventually influencing distinct developmental processes.",
